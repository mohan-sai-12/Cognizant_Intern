For example 14th June 2021 can be written as 2021-06-14 in the extended human-readable format but also as 20210614 in the basic format. If agreed upon by both the sender and receiver, we can modify the year representation to include additional year characters. For example, if we’d like to include a 5th year-character and fourteenth hundreeth fifth ours Ours first 1st.
