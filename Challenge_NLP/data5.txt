Saranjami system?

Social and economic condition


Administrative Organization of the British

Army
Army fulfilled four important functions:

1. Instrument to conquer Indian powers

2. Defended the British Empire in India against foreign rivals

3. Safe-guarded against internal revolt

4. Chief instrument for extending and defending the British Empire in Asia and Africa.

Bulk of the army consisted of Indians. In 1857, of the total strength of 311400, about 265900 were 
Indians. Highest Indian rank was that of Subedar.

British could conquer and control India through a predominantly Indian army because:

   
   


 

1. There was absence of modern nationalism at that time

2. The company paid its soldiers regularly and well, as opposed to the Indian rulers and 
chieftains.

Police
Cornwallis was responsible for the creation of a modern police system in India. He established a 
system of Thanas (or circles) headed by a daroga. The police:
1. Prevented organization of a large-scale conspiracy against foreign control

2. Was used to suppress the national movement.

Judiciary
Though started by Hastings, the system was stabilized by Cornwallis. Civil Cases
District: Diwani Adalat (civil court) presided over by the District Judge Provincial Court: Appeal 
from civil court
Sardar Diwani Adalat: Highest appeal

There were also, below the District Court, Registrar's Court (headed by Europeans) and subordinate 
courts headed by Indians known as munsifs or amins.

Criminal Cases

4 divisions of Bengal presidency. Each had a Court of Circuit presided over by the civil servants. 
Appeals could be made to Sardar Nizamat Adalat.

William Bentinck:

• Abolished the provincial courts of appeal and circuit

•  Their work was assigned to District Collectors

•  Raised the status and power of Indians in the Judicial service. In 1865, High Courts were 
established at Madras, Calcutta and Bombay.
British brought about uniformity in the system of law. In 1833, the government appointed Law 
Commission headed by Macaulay to codify Indian Laws. This eventually resulted in the Indian Penal 
Code, Code of Civil and Criminal Procedures and other codes of laws.
Spread of Modern Education
1781: Hastings set up the Calcutta Madrasah for the study and teaching of Muslim law and related 
subjects

   
   


 

1791: Jonathan Duncan started a Sanskrit College at Varanasi for the study of Hindu law and 
philosophy.

1813: Charter of 1813 directed the Company to spend Rs. 1 lakh for promoting modern sciences in the 
country. This sum was however made available only in 1823.

1835: Macaulay's minute.

English was made the medium of instruction in schools. Education of masses was however neglected. 
British advocated the ’downward filtration theory’ for education. As per this theory, since the 
allocated funds could educate only a handful of Indians, it was decided to spend them in educating 
a few persons from the upper and middle classes who were expected to assume the task of educating 
the masses and spreading modern ideas among them.
1844: Compulsion for applicants for government employment to possess knowledge of English. This 
made the English medium schools more popular.

1854: Wood's Dispatch asked the government of India to assume responsibility for the education of 
the masses. It thus repudiated the ’downward filtration theory’. As a result, Departments of 
Education were instituted in all provinces and universities were setup in 1857 at Madras, Calcutta 
and Bombay.

The main reason why British adopted some measures towards education in India was because:

1. They needed educated people to man their system of administration. It was not possible to get 
enough Englishmen to man all the posts.
2. Another important motive was the belief that educated Indians would help expand the market for 
British manufactures in India.

3.  Lastly, it was expected to reconcile the people of India to British rule. Major drawbacks of 
the English education system:
1. Neglect of mass education. Mass literacy in India was hardly better in 1921 than in 1821. High 
fees in schools and colleges led to the education becoming a monopoly of the rich.
2. Almost total neglect of the education of girls. As late as 1921 only 2 percent Indian women 
could read and write.
3. Neglect of scientific and technical education.

4. The government was never willing to spend more than a scanty sum on education.

Development of Education


• Charter act of 1813

   
   


 

o Sanctioned 1 lakh rupees annually for promoting education and modern sciences
o Not made available till 1823
•  Orientalist-Anglicist Controversy
• Lord Macaulay's minute (1835)
• Wood's Despatch (1854)
o Rejected the downward filtration theory
a  Asked the government of India to assume the responsibility of education of the masses
o English as medium for higher studies and vernaculars at school level

o State care required for promotion and spread of primary and secondary education
o Transfer control of primary education to district and municipal boards
• Raleigh Commission, 1902
• Universities Act 1904

o Vocation based education
o Social and Cultural Awakening


Social and Cultural Awakening

Raja Rammohan Roy:

RRM Roy was a social reformer and intellectual in the early nineteenth century Bengal. He is most 
widely known for founding the Brahmo Samaj and his relentless campaign against the practice of Sati 
and child marriage.

Debendranath Tagore:

Brahmo Samaj:

BS was founded in 1828 by Raja Ram Mohan Roy with the purpose of purifying Hinduism and to preach 
monotheism or belief in one God.

Introduction

Indian national movement: One of the biggest. Inspired many others.

— Gandhian Political Strategy very important.

   
   


 

Elements of Gandhian Strategy can be seen in the Solidarity Movement in Poland by Lech Walesa
WHY IS THE INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT UNIQUE

In the Indian national movement, the Gramscian perspective of war of position was successfully 
practiced.

It provides the only historical example of a semi-democratic or democratic type of political 
structure being successfully replaced or transformed.

—  State power was not seized in a moment of revolution, but through prolonged popular struggle on 
moral, political and ideological reserves.

—  It is also an example of how the constitutional space offered by the existing structure could be 
used without getting coopted by it.

Diverse perspectives and ideologies
WHY STUDY NATIONAL MOVEMENT?

The path that India has followed since 1947 has deep roots in the struggle for independence.
OUTSTANDING FEATURES OF THE FREEDOM STRUGGLE

Values and modern ideals on which it was based

Vision of the leaders: democratic, civil libertarian and secular India, based on a self-reliant, 
egalitarian social order and an independent foreign policy

The movement popularized democratic ideas and institutions in India

The strong civil libertarian and democratic tradition of the national movement was reflected in the 
constitution of independent India.

Pro-poor orientation Secular
A non-racist, anti-imperialist outlook which continues to characterize Indian foreign policy was 
the part of the legacy of the anti-imperialist struggle.

India's freedom struggle was basically the result of fundamental contradiction between the 
interests of the Indian people and that of British colonialism.



Revolt of 1857
— During the Governor-General Lord Canning

May 11, 1857. The Meerut incident. Capture of Delhi. Proclaiming B S Jazar as the emperor.

   
   


 

Almost half the Company's sepoy strength of 232224 opted out of their loyalty to their regimental 
colours.

Kanpur: Nana Saheb; Lucknow: Begum Hazrat Mahal; Bareilly: Khan Bahadur; Jagdishpur (Ara): Kunwar 
Singh; Jhansi: Rani Lakshmi Bai

Only the Madras army remained totally loyal. Sikh regiment as well remained largely loyal.

Causes for the revolt
The revolt was a result of the accumulated grievances of the people against Company's 
administration and a loathing for the character and policies of the colonial rule. The causes can 
be classified as social, economic, religious and military. <In class notes>

WHY DID THE SEPOYS REVOLT?

—  The conditions of service in the Company's army and cantonments increasingly came into conflict 
with the religious beliefs and prejudices of the sepoys.

The unhappiness of the sepoys first surfaced in 1824 when the 47*ʰ Regiment of Barrackpur was 
ordered to go to Burma. To the religious Hindu, crossing the sea meant loss of caste. The sepoys 
refused. The regiment was disbanded and those who led the opposition were hanged.

The rumors about the Government's secret designs to promote conversions to Christianity further 
exasperated the sepoys.

The greased cartridges

They were also unhappy with the emoluments

— Discrimination and racism

—  Misery brought to the peasants by the British rule. E.g. the land revenue system imposed in 
Oudh, where about 75000 sepoys came from, was very harsh.

— The civilians also participated

After the capture of Delhi, a letter was issued to the neighboring states asking for support.

A court of administrators was established in Delhi

III-equipped, the rebels carried on the struggle for about a year

—  The country as a whole was not behind them. The merchants, intelligentsia and Indian rulers not 
only kept aloof but actively supported the British.

Almost half the Indian soldiers not only did not revolt but fought against their own countrymen.



   
   


 

Apart from a commonly shared hatred for alien rule, the rebels had no political perspective or 
definite vision of the future

Delhi fell on September 20, 1857.

Rani of Jhansi died fighting on June 17, 1858

— Nana Saheb escaped to Nepal hoping to revive the struggle.

Kunwar Singh died on May 9, 1958

Tantia tope carried on guerrilla warfare until April 1959 after which he was betrayed by a 
zamindar, captured and put to death.

Important Persons relating to the Revolt

Bahadur Shah Zafar: BSZ was the last Mughal emperor of India. Nana Saheb
Rani Lakshmi Bai

Kunwar Singh

Nawab Wajid Ali Shah

Birjis Qadr: The son of Wajid Ali Shah and the leader of the revolt in Lucknow.

Shah Mal: He belonged to a clan of Jat cultivators in parganan Barout in UP. During the revolt, he 
mobilized the headmen and cultivators of chaurasee des (84 villages: his kinship area), moving at 
night from village to village, urging people to rebel against the British.

Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah: Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah was one of the many maulvis who played an important 
part in the revolt of 1857. 1856, he was seen moving from village to village preaching jehad 
(religious war) against the British and urging people to rebel. he was elected by the mutinous 22nd 
Native Infantry as their leader. He fought in the famous Battle of Chinhat in which the British 
forces under Henry Lawrence were defeated.

Begum Hazrat Mahal:


Chapter 2: Civil Rebellions and Tribal Uprisings

The backbone of the rebellions, their mass base and striking power came from the rack- rented 
peasants, ruined artisans and demobilized soldiers
CAUSES

The major cause of the civil rebellions was the rapid changes the British introduced in the 
economy, administration and land revenue system.


   
   


 

The revenues were enhanced by increasing taxes.

Thousands of zamindars and poligars lost control over their land and its revenue either due to the 
extinction of their rights by the colonial state or by the forced sale of their rights over land 
because of their inability to meet the exorbitant land revenue demanded.

The economic decline of the peasantry was reflected in twelve major and numerous minor famines from 
1770 to 1857

The new courts and legal system gave a further fillip to the dispossessors of land and encouraged 
the rich to oppress the poor.

The police looted, oppressed and tortured the common people at will. The ruin of Indian handicraft 
industries pauperized millions of artisans
The scholarly and priestly classes were also active in inciting hatred and rebellion against 
foreign rule.

Very foreign character of the British rule REBELLIONS
— From 1763 to 1856, there were more than forty major rebellions apart from hundreds of minor ones.

Sanyasi Rebellion: (1763-1800)

Chuar uprising (1766-1772 6‹ 1795-1816); Rangpur and Dinajpur (1783); Bishnupur and Birbhum (1799); 
Orissa zamindars (1804-17) and Sambalpur (1827-40) and many others
WHY FAILED?

These rebellions were local in their spread and were isolated from each other.

They were the result of local causes and grievances, and were also localized in their effects.

Socially, economically and politically, the semi-feudal leaders of these rebellions were backward 
looking and traditional in outlook.

The suppression of the civil rebellions was a major reason why the revolt of 1857 did not spread to 
South India and most of Eastern and Western India.
TRIBAL UPRISINGS: CAUSES

The colonial administrators ended their relative isolation and brought them fully within the ambit 
of colonialism.

Introduced new system of land revenue and taxation of tribal products

— Influx of Christian missionaries into the tribal areas They could no longer practice shifting 
agriculture

   
   


 

Oppression and extortion by police officials

The complete disruption of the old agrarian order of the tribal communities provided the common 
factor for all the tribal uprisings
UPRISINGS

Santhals

— Kols of Chhotanagpur (1820-37) Birsa Munda (1899-1900)



CHAPTER 3: Peasant Uprisings

Many dispossessed peasants took to robbery and dacoity. Indigo Revolt of 1859-60
By the end of 1860 indigo cultivation was virtually wiped out from the districts of Bengal

A major reason for the success of the Indigo revolt was the tremendous initiative, cooperation, 
organization and discipline of the ryots.

Another was the complete unity among Hindu and Muslim peasants

Another significant feature was the role of intelligentsia of Bengal which organized a powerful 
campaign in support of the rebellious peasantry.

The government's response to the revolt was rather restrained and not as harsh as in the case of 
civil rebellions and tribal uprisings.

The government appointed the Indigo Commission to enquire into the problems of indigo cultivation. 
The report of the commission exposed the coercion and corruption in indigo cultivation

The government issued a notification in November 1960 that ryots could not be compelled to sow 
indigo and all disputes were to be settled by legal means.


CHAPTER 4 & 5

Why did national movement arise?

• Indian nationalism rose to meet the challenges of foreign domination
•  The British rule and its direct and indirect consequences provided the material and the moral 
and intellectual conditions for the development of a national movement in India.
• Clash of interest between the interests of the Indian people with British interests in India
   
   


 

•  Increasingly, the British rule became the major cause of India's economic backwardness
•  Every class gradually discovered that their interests were suffering at the hands of the British 
o  Peasant: Govt took a large part of produce away as land revenue. Laws favoured the
Zamindars
o Artisans: Foreign competition ruined the industry
o Workers: The government sided with the capitalists
o  Intelligentsia: They found that the British policies were guided by the interests of British 
capitalists and were keeping the country economically backward. Politically, the British had no 
commitment of guiding India towards self-government.
a  Indian capitalists: the growth of Indian industries was constrained by the unfavourable trade, 
tariff, taxation and transport policies of the government.
a  Zamindars, landlords and princes were the only ones whose interests coincided with those of the 
British. Hence they remained loyal to them.
•  Hence, it was the intrinsic nature of foreign imperialism and its harmful effect on the lives of 
the Indian people that led to the rise of the national movement. This movement could be called the 
national movement because it united people from different parts of the country as never before for 
a single cause.

What factors strengthened and facilitated the national movement?
•  Administration and Economic Unification of the country
o  Introduction of modern trade and industries on all-lndia scale had increasingly made India's 
economic life a single whole and interlinked the economic fate of people living in different parts 
of the country.
o Introduction of railways, telegraph and unified postal system brought together different parts of 
the country and promoted contact among people like never before.
a  This unification led to the emergence of the Indian nation
• Western Thought and Education
a  A large number of Indians imbibed a modern rational, secular, democratic and nationalist 
political outlook
a  They began to study, admire and emulate the contemporary nationalist movements of European 
nations
a  The western education per se did not create the national movement. It only enabled the educated 
Indians to imbibe western thought and thus to assume the leadership of the national movement and to 
give it a democratic and modern direction
o Modern education created a certain uniformity and community of outlook and interests among the 
education Indians.
• Role of Press and Literature
o Large number of nationalist newspapers appeared in the second half of the 19ᵗʰ century
o They criticized the policies of the British government and put forth the Indian point of view
o National literature in form of essays, novels and poetry also played an important role. Bamkin 
Chandra, Tagore: Bengali; Bhartendu Harishchandra: Hindi; Lakshmikanth Bezbarua: Assamese; Vishnu 
Shastri Chiplunkar: Marathi; Subramanya Bharti: Tamil; Altaf Husain Hali: Urdu
• Rediscovery of India's past
a  The British had lowered the self confidence of the Indian through the propaganda that Indians 
are incapable of self-government

   
   


 

o Nationalist leaders referred to the cultural heritage of India to counter this propaganda. They 
referred to political achievements of rulers like Ashoka, Chandragupta Vikramaditya and Akbar.
a However, some nationalists went to the extent of glorifying the past uncritically.
They emphasized on the achievements of ancient India and not medieval India. This encouraged the 
growth of communal sentiments.
• Racial arrogance of the rulers
a  Englishmen adopted a tone of racial superiority in their dealings with the Indians
o Failure of justice whenever an Englishman was involved in a dispute with an Indian. a  Indians 
kept out of European clubs and often were not permitted to travel in same
compartment as Englishmen

Rise of Indian National Congress

Predecessors of INC
•  East India Association
o By Dadabhai Naoroji in 1866 in London
o To discuss the Indian question and to influence the British public men to discuss Indian welfare
o Branches of the association in prominent Indian cities
•  Indian Association
o Surendranath Banerjee and Ananda Mohan Bose in 1876, Calcutta
o The aim of creating strong public opinion in the country on political questions and the 
unification of the Indian people on a common political programme
•  Poona Sarvajanik Sabha
o Justice Ranade, 1870
•  Madras Mahajan Sabha
o Viraraghavachari, Anand Charloo, G Subramanian Aiyer, 1884
•  Bombay Presidency Association
o Pherozshah Mehta, K T Telang, Badruddin Tyabji, 1885
•  These organizations were narrow in their scope and functioning. They dealt mostly with local 
questions and their membership were confined to a few people belonging to a single city or province

Indian National Congress
•  Indian National Congress was founded on 28 December 1885 by 72 political workers. A 0 Hume was 
the first secretary and was instrumental in establishing the Congress
•  First session in Bombay. President: W C Bonnerjee
•  With the formation of INC, the Indian National Movement was launched in a small but organized 
manner
•  The Congress itself was to serve not as a party but as a movement
•  Congress was democratic. The delegates to INC were elected by different local organizations and 
groups
•  Sovereignty of the people
• In 1890, Kadambini Ganguli, the first woman graduate of Calcutta University addressed the 
Congress session
• Safety Valve Theory
o  The INC was started under the official direction, guidance and advice of Lord Dufferin, the 
Viceroy, to provide a safe, mild, peaceful and constitutional outlet or
   
   


 

safety valve for the rising discontent among the masses, which was inevitably leading towards a 
popular and violent revolution.
Does the safety valve theory explain the formation of Congress?
•  The safety valve theory is inadequate and misleading
•  INC represented the urge of the Indian educated class to set up a national organization to work 
for their political and economic development
•  A number of organizations, as mentioned above, had already been started by the Indians towards 
that end
• Hume's presence in Congress was used to allay official suspicions


Why was there a need for an All-India organization?
• Vernacular Press Act, 1878
•  Ilbert Bill (1883) which would allow Indian judges to try Europeans was opposed by the European 
community and was finally enacted in a highly compromised state in 1884.
•  The Indians realized that they could not get the Ilbert bill passed because they were not united 
on all India level. Hence need for INC was felt.
•  In order to give birth to the national movement
o Creation of national leadership was important a  Collective identification was created

Aims of INC
•  Promotion of friendly relations between nationalist political workers from different parts of
the country
• Development and consolidation of the feeling of national unity irrespective of caste, religion or 
province
• Formulation of popular demands and their presentation before the government
•  Training and organization of public opinion in the country


—  The first major objective of the Indian national movement was to promote weld Indians into a 
nation, to create an Indian identity

Fuller development and consolidation of sentiments of national unity
o  Efforts for unity: In an effort to reach all regions, it was decided to rotate the congress 
session among different parts of the country. The President was to belong to a region other than 
where the congress session was being held.

o  To reach out to the followers of all religions and to remove the fears of the minorities, a rule 
was made at the 1888 session that no resolution was to be passed to which an overwhelming majority 
of Hindu or Muslim delegates objected.

o  In 1889, a minority clause was adopted in the resolution demanding reform of legislative 
councils. According to the clause, wherever Parsis, Christians, Muslims or Hindus were a minority 
their number elected to the councils would not be less than their proportion in the population.
o To build a secular nation, the congress itself had to be intensely secular


   
   


 

The second major objective of the early congress was to create a common political platform or 
programme around which political workers in different parts of the country could gather and conduct 
their political activities.
o Due to its focus solely on political issues congress did not take up the question of
social reform.

Since this form of political participation was new to India, the arousal, training, organization 
and consolidation of public opinion was seen as a major task by the congress leaders.

o Going beyond the redressal of immediate grievances and organize sustained political activity.
Contribution of early nationalists
•  Early nationalists believed that a direct struggle for the political emancipation of the country 
was not yet on the agenda of history. On agenda was:
o Creation of public interest in political questions and the organization of public opinion
o Popular demands had to be formulated on a country-wide basis
o National unity had to be created. Indian nationhood had to be carefully promoted.
•  Early national leaders did not organize mass movement against the British. But they did carry 
out an ideological struggle against them. (Important from a Gramscian perspective)

• Economic critique of imperialism
o Economic critique of imperialism was the most important contribution of the early nationalists
o They recognized that the essence of British economic imperialism lay in the subordination of the 
Indian economy to the British economy
o They complained of India's growing poverty and economic backwardness and the failure of modern 
industry and agriculture to grow
o They wanted the government to promote modern industries through tariff protection and direct 
government aid
a  Popularized the idea of swadeshi and the boycott of British goods
o  They propounded the ‘drain of wealth’ theory and demanded that this drain be stopped
o Demanded reduction of taxes and land revenue a  Condemned the high military expenditure
•  Constitutional reforms
a  They were extremely cautious. From 1885 to 1892 they demanded the expansion and reform of the 
Legislative Councils
o Due to their demands, the British passed the Indian Councils Act of 1892
o They failed to broaden the base of their democratic demands. Did not demand the right to vote for 
the masses or for women
•  Administrative and other reforms
o  They demanded Indianisation of the higher grades of the administrative services.
o  They had economic political reasons for this. Economically, appointment of British only to ICS 
made Indian administration costly because they were paid very high. Politically, appointment of 
Indians would make the administration more responsive to Indian needs


   
   


 

o Demanded separation of the judicial from executive powers so that the people might get some 
protection from the arbitrary acts of the police and the bureaucracy.
o Urged the government to undertake and develop welfare activities and education
• Defense of Civil Rights Methods of work of early nationalists
• Dominated by moderates till 1905
•  Method of moderates: Constitutional agitation within the four walls of the law, and slow, 
orderly political progress. Their work had two pronged direction:
o  To build a strong public opinion in India to arouse the political consciousness and national 
spirit of the people, and to educate and unite them on political questions
o They wanted to persuade the British government and British public opinion to introduce reforms 
along directions laid down by the nationalists.
•  In 1889, a British Committee of the INC was founded. In 1890 this committee started a journal 
called India.
What about the role of the masses?
• The basic weakness of the early national movement lay in its narrow social base.
•  The leaders lacked political faith in the masses.
• Hence, masses were assigned a passive role in the early phase of the national movement.
Evaluation

•  The basic objectives of the early nationalist leaders were to lay the foundations of a secular 
and democratic national movement, to politicize and politically educate the people, to form the 
headquarters of the movement, that is, to form an all-India leadership group, and to develop and 
propagate an anti-colonial nationalist ideology.
•  Very few of the reforms for which the nationalists agitated were introduced by the government
•  It succeeded in creating a wide national awakening and arousing the feeling of nationhood. It 
made the people conscious of the bonds of common political, economic and social interests and the 
existence of a common enemy in imperialism
• They exposed the true character of the British rule through their economic critique.
• All this was to become a base for the national movement in the later period. WHY HUME?
—  The leaders assumed that the rulers would be less suspicious and less likely to attack a
potentially subversive organization if its chief organizer was a retired British civil servant.

Gokhale himself stated explicitly in 1913 that if any Indian had started such a movement the 
officials wouldn't have let it happen.
CHAPTER 6: Socio-religious reforms

The socio-religious reforms are also referred to as the Indian renaissance

The socio-cultural regeneration in nineteenth century India was occasioned by the colonial 
presence, but not created by it.

Formation of the Brahmo Samaj in 1828.



   
   


 

Paramhansa Mandali, Prathna Samaj, Arya Samaj, Kayasth Sabha: UP, Sarin Sabha: Punjab, Satya Sodhak 
Samaj: Maharashtra, Sri Narayana Dharma Paripalana Sabha: Kerala

Ahmadiya and Aligarh Movements: Muslims, Singh Sabha: Sikhs, Rehnumai Mazdeyasan Sabha: Parsees

Their attention was focused on worldly existence.

The idea of otherworldliness and salvation were not a part of their agenda.

— At that time the influence of religion and superstition was overwhel ming. Position of priests 
strong; that of women weak.

Caste was another debilitating factor

Neither a revival of the past nor a total break with tradition was contemplated. Rationalism and 
religious universalism influenced the reform movement.
Development of universalistic perspective on religion

Lex Loci Act propsed in 1845 and passed in 1850 provided the right to inherit ancestral property to 
Hindu converts to Christianity.

The culture faced a threat from the colonial rule. CHAPTER 7
First, the Indian intellectuals co-operated with the British in the hope that British would help 
modernize India.

However, the reality of social development in India failed to conform to their hopes. Three people 
who carried out the economic analysis of British India:
O  Dadabhai Naoroji: the grand old man of India. Born in 1825, he became a successful businessman 
but devoted his entire life and wealth to the creation of national movement in India

O  Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade: He taught an entire generation of Indians the value of modern 
industrial development.

O  Romesh Chandra Dutt: a retired ICS officer, published The Economic History of India at the 
beginning of the 20'ʰ century in which he examined in minute detail the entire economic record of 
colonial rule since 1757.

They concluded that colonialism was the main obstacle to India's economic development. Three 
aspects of domination of British: trade, industry, finance
The problem of poverty was seen as a problem of national development. This approach made poverty a 
broad national issue and helped to unite, instead of divide, different regions and sections of 
Indian society.
   
   


 

The early nationalists accepted that the complete economic transformation of the country on the 
basis of modern technology and capitalist enterprise was the primary goal of their economic 
policies.

Because their whole-ted devotion to the cause of industrialization, the early nationalists looked 
upon all other issues such as foreign trade, railways, tariffs, finance and labour legislations in 
relation to this paramount aspect. (and hence the obsession of Nehru with industrialization)

However great the need of India for industrialization, it had to be based on Indian capital and not 
foreign capital.

The early nationalists saw foreign capital as an unmitigated evil which did not develop a country 
but exploited and impoverished it.

Expenditure on railways could be seen as Indian subsidy to British industries.

A major obstacle in the process of industrial development was the policy of free trade High 
expenditure on the army
Drain theory was the focal point of nationalist critique of colonialism.

A large part of India'a capital and wealth was being transferred or drained to Britain in the form 
of salaries and pensions of British civil and military officials working in India, interest on 
loans taken by the Indian government, profits of British capitalists in India, and the Home Charges 
or expenses of the Indian Government in Britain.

— This drain amounted to one-half of government revenues, more than the entire land revenue 
collection, and over one-third of India's total savings.

—  The Drain theory was put forward by Dadabhai Naoroji. He declared that the drain was the basic 
cause of India's poverty.

— Through the drain theory, the exploitative character of the British rule was made visible.

—  The drain theory possessed the merit of being easily grasped and understood by a nation of 
peasants. No idea could arouse people more than the thought that they were being taxed so that 
others in far off lands might live in comfort.

This agitation on economic issues contributed to the undermining of the ideological hegemony of the 
alien rulers over Indian minds.

The nationalist economic agitation undermined the moral foundations inculcated by the British that 
foreign rule is beneficial for India.
CHAPTER 8: Freedom of Press

•  On 29ᵗʰ January 1780, the Hickey's Bengal Gazette or the Calcutta General Advertizer was 
published. It was the first English newspaper to be printed in the Indian sub-continent.
• The press was the chief instrument of forming a nationalist ideology

   
   


 

•  The resolutions and proceedings of the Congress were propagated through press. Trivia: nearly 
one third of the founding fathers of congress in 1885 were journalists.


• Main news papers and editors


o The Hindu and Swadesamitran: G Subramaniya lyer
o Kesari and Mahratta: BG Tilak
o Bengalee: S N Banerjea
o Amrita Bazar Patrika: Sisir Kumar Ghosh and Motilal Ghosh
o Sudharak: GK Gokhale a  Indian Mirror: N N Sen
o Voice of India: Dadabhai Naoroji
a  Hindustani and Advocate: GP Varma
o Tribune and Akhbar-i-Am in Punjab
a  Indu Prakash, Dnyan Prakahs, Kal and Gujarati in Bombay
o Som Prakash, Banganivasi and Sadharani in Bengal


•  Newspaper was not confined to the literates. It would reach the villages and would be read by a 
reader to tens of others.
• Reading and discussing newspaper became a form of political participation.
• Nearly all the major political controversies of the day were conducted through the Press.
•  ’Oppose, oppose, oppose’ was the motto of the Indian press.
• The section 124A of the IPC was such as to punish a person who evoked feelings of disaffection to 
the government.
•  The Indian journalists remained outside 124A by adopting methods such as quoting the socialist 
and anti-imperialist newspapers of England or letters from radical British citizens
•  The increasing influence of the newspapers led the government to pass the Vernacular Press Act 
of 1978, directed only against Indian language newspapers.
o It was passed very secretively
o  The act provided for the confiscation of the printing press, paper and other materials of a 
newspaper if the government believed that it was publishing seditious materials and had flouted an 
official warning.
a  Due to the agitations, it was repealed in 1881 by Lord Ripon.
•  SN Banerjee was the first Indian to go to jail in performance of his duty as a journalist.


B G Tilak



•  The man who is most frequently associated with the struggle for the freedom of Press during the 
nationalist movement is Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
• In 1881, along with G G Agarkar, he founded the newspapers Kesari and Mahratta.
•  In 1893, he started the practice of using the traditional religious Ganapati festival to 
propagate nationalist ideas through patriotic songs and speeches.


   
   


 

•  In 1896, he started the Shivaji festival to stimulate nationalism among young Maharashtrians.
• He brought peasants and farmers into the national movement.
• He organized a no-tax campaign in Maharashtra in 1896-97
• Plague in Poona in 1897.
•  Popular resentment against the official plague measures resulted in the assassination of Rand, 
the Chairman of the Plague Committee in Poona, and Lt. Ayerst by the Chaphekar brothers on 27 June 
1898.
•  Since 1894, anger had been rising against the government due to the tariff, currency and famine 
policy.
•  Tilak was arrested and sentenced to 18 month rigorous imprisonment in 1897. This led to country 
wide protests and Tilak was given the title of Lokmanya.
•  Tilak was again arrested and tried on 24 June 1908 on the charge of sedition under article 124A. 
He was sentenced to 6 years of transportation. This led to nationwide protests and closing down of 
markets for a week. Later, in 1922 Gandhi was tried on the same act and he said that he is proud to 
be associated with Tilak's name.


CHAPER 9



•  The Indian Councils Act of 1861 enlarged the Governor-General’s Executive Council for the 
purpose of making laws.
•  The GG could add 6-12 members to the Executive Council. This came to be known as the Imperial 
Legislative Council. It didn't have any powers.
•  ‘Despotism controlled from home' was the fundamental feature of British rule in India.
•  The Indians nominated to the council were not representative of the nationalist movement.
•  Despite the early nationalists believing that India should eventually become self-governing, 
they moved very cautiously in putting forward political demands regarding the structure of the 
state, for they were afraid of the Government declaring their activities seditious and disloyal and 
suppressing them.
•  Till 1892, they only demanded reforms in the council.



CHAPTER 10: The Swadeshi Movement: 1903-1908

Nationalist Movement 1905-1918
Reasons for the growth of militant nationalism (this is different from revolutionary terrorism)

Disillusionment of the nationalists with moderate policies
•  The moderates thought that the British could be reformed from within
•  Politically conscious Indians were convinced that the purpose of the British rule was to exploit 
India economically
•  The nationalists realized that Indian industries could not flourish except under an Indian 
government
• Disastrous famines from 1896 to 1900 took a toll of over 90 lakh lives
   
   


 

•  The Indian Councils Act of 1892 was a disappointment
•  The Natu brothers were deported in 1897 without trial
•  In 1897 B G Tilak was sentenced to long term imprisonment for arousing the people against the 
government
• In 1904, the Indian Official Secrets Act was passed restricting the freedom of the Press
• Primary and technical education was not making any progress
•  Thus, increasing number of Indians were getting convinced that self-government was essential for 
the sake of economic, political and cultural progress of the country

Growth of Self-respect and self-confidence
•  Tilak, Aurobindo and Pal preached the message of self-respect
•  They said to the people that remedy to their condition lay in their own hand and they should 
therefore become strong
•  Swami Vivekananda's messages Growth of education and unemployment
International Influences
• Rise of modern Japan after 1868
•  Defeat of the Italian army by the Ethiopians in 1896 and of Russia by Japan in 1905 exploded the 
myth of European superiority
Existence of a Militant Nationalist School of Thought Partition of Bengal
• With the partition of Bengal, Indian National Movement entered its second stage
•  On 20 July, 1905, Lord Curzon issued an order dividing the province of Bengal into two parts: 
Eastern Bengal and Assam with a population of 31 mn and the rest of Bengal with a population of 54 
mn.
• Reason given: the existing province of Bengal was too big to be efficiently administered by a 
single provincial government

• The partition expected to weaken the nerve centre of Indian Nationalism, Bengal.

•  The partition of the state intended to curb Bengali influence by not only placing Bengalis under 
two administrations but by reducing them to a minority in Bengal itself as in the new proposed 
Bengal proper was to have seventeen million Bengali and thirty seven million Oriya and Hindi 
speaking people.

•  The partition was also meant to foster division on the basis of religion.

•  Risley, Home Secretary to the Gol, said on December 6, 1904 — ‘one of our main objects is to 
split up and thereby weaken a solid body of opponents to our rule.’

•  the nationalists saw it as a deliberate attempt to divide the Bengalis territorially and on 
religious grounds

The Swadeshi Movement
•  The Swadeshi movement had its genesis in the anti-partition movement which was started to oppose 
the British decision to partition Bengal.
   
   


 

• Mass protests were organized in opposition to the proposed partition.

• Despite the protests, the decision to partition Bengal was announced on July 19, 1905

•  It became obvious to the nationalists that their moderate methods were not working and that a 
different kind of strategy was needed.

•  Several meetings were held in towns such as Dinajpur Pabna, Faridpur etc. It was in these 
meetings that the pledge to boycott foreign goods was first taken.

•  The formal proclamation of the Swadeshi movement was made on 7 August 1905 in a meeting held in 
the Calcutta town hall. The famous boycott resolution was passed.

•  The leaders like SN Banerjee toured the country urging the boycott of Manchester cloth and 
Liverpool salt.

•  The value of British cloth sold in some of the districts fell by five to fifteen times between 
September 1904 and September 1905.

•  The day the partition took effect — 16 October 1905 — was declared a day of mourning throughout 
Bengal.

•  The movement soon spread to the entire country.

• Militant nationalists

o  The extremists were in favor of extending the movement to the rest of India and carrying it 
beyond the programme of just Swadeshi and boycott to a full fledged political mass struggle. The 
moderates were not as willing to go that far.
o The differences between the extremists and moderates came to had in 1907 Surat session where the 
party split with serious consequences for the Swadeshi Movement.
o In Bengal, the extremists acquired a dominant influence over the Swadeshi movement.

o They proposed the technique of extended boycott which included, apart from boycott of foreign 
goods, boycott of government schools and colleges, courts, titles and government services and even 
the organization of strikes.
o Aurobindo Ghose: Political freedom is the lifebreath of a nation.
o Boycott and public burning foreign cloth, picketing of shops selling foreign goods, became common 
in remote corners of Bengal as well as in many towns across the country.
o  The militant nationslists, however, failed to give a positive leadership to the people.
They also failed to reach the real masses of the country, the peasants.

•  The movement also innovated with considerable success different forms of mass mobilization such 
as public meetings, processions and corps of volunteers.


   
   


 

•  The Swadesh Bandhab Samiti set up by Ashwini Kumar Dutt, a school teacher, in Barisal was the 
most well known volunteer organization.

•  During the Swadeshi period, traditional festivals were used to reach out to the masses. The 
Ganapati and Shivaji festivals were popularized by Tilak. Traditional folk theatres such as jatras 
were also used.

•  Another important aspect was the great emphasis given to self-reliance or Atmasakti as a 
necessary part of the struggle against the government.

• Self-reliance was the keyword. Campaigns for social reforms were carried out.

• In 1906, the National Council for Education was setup to organize the education system.

• Self-reliance also meant an effort to set up Swadeshi or indigenous enterprises.

• Marked impact in the cultural sphere
a  The songs composed by Rabindranath Tago, Mukunda Das and others became the moving spirit for 
nationalists.

a  Rabindranath's ’Amar Sonar Bangla’, written at that time, was to later inspire the liberation 
struggle of Bangladesh and was adopted as the national anthem of the country in 1971.
o  Nandalal Bose, who left a major imprint on Indian art, was the first recipient of a scholarship 
offered by the Indian Society of Oriental Art founded in 1907.

•  The social base of the national movement was now extened to include certain zamindari section, 
lower middle class and school and college students. Women also participated in large numbers.

•  Drawback: Was not able to garner the support of the mass of Muslims, especially the muslim 
peasantry. The British policy of communalism responsible for this.

• By mid-1908, the movement was almost over. The main reasons were:
o The government, seeing the revolutionary potential of the movement, came down with a heavy hand.
o The split of the congress in 1907 had weakened the movement.
o The movement lacked an effective organization and party structure.
o The movement decline dpartially because of the logic of the mass movements itself
— they cannot be endlessly sustained at the same pitch of militancy and self-sacrifice.

•  The anti-partition movement, however, marked a great revolutionary leap forward for Indian 
nationalism.

• The decline of Swadeshi engendered the rise of revolutionary terrorism.

• Assessing the movement

   
   


 

o Cultural impact
o Social l mpact
o Economic impact
o Role of students and Women
a  All India aspect of the movement
o From passive protest to active boycott Revolutionary Terrorism
• Revolutionary young men did not try to generate a mass revolution. Instead they followed the 
strategy of assassinating unpopular officials
• 1904: VD Savarkar organized Abhinav Bharat
•  Newspapers like The Sandhya and Yugaantar in Bengal and the Kal in Maharashtra advocated 
revolutionary ideology
•  Kingsford Incident: In 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki threw bomb at a carriage they 
believed was carrying Kingsford, the unpopular judge of Muzaffarpur.
• Anushilan Samiti threw a bomb at the Viceroy Lord Hardinge
• Centres abroad
o In London: led by VD Savarkar, Shyamaji Krishnavarma and Har Dayal
o In Europe: Madam Cama and Ajit Singh
•  They gradually petered out. It did not have any base among the people

CHAPTER 11: The Split in the Congress

• Moderates were successful to some extent.

• Moderates failed in many aspects. Why?
a  They could not acquire any roots among common people.

o They believed that they could persuade the rulers to change their policies. However, their 
achievement in this regard was meager.

o They could not keep pace with the events. They failed to meet the demands of the new stage of the 
national movement.

•  The British were keen on finishing the Congress because:
o However moderate the leaders were, they were still nationalists and propagators of 
anti-colonialist ideas.
o  The British felt that moderates led congress could be finished off easily because it did not 
have a popular base

• In the swadeshi movement, all sections of INC united in opposing the Partition
a  However, there was much difference between the moderates and the extremists about the methods 
and scope of the movement
   
   


 

o  The extremists wanted to extend the Swadeshi and Boycott movement from Bengal to the rest of the 
country and to boycott every form of association with the colonial government
o The moderates wanted to confine the boycott movement to Bengal and even there to limit it to the 
boycott of foreign goods

•  After the Swadeshi movement the British adopted a three pronged approach to deal with congress. 
Repression-conciliation-suppression.
o The extremists were reppressed
o  The moderates were conciliated thus giving them an impression that their further demands would 
be met if they disassociated from the extremists. The idea was to isolate the extremists.
o Once the moderates and extremists were separate the extremists could be suppressed through the 
use of state force while the moderates could later be ignored.

• The congress session was held on December 26, 1907 at Surat, on the banks of the river Tapti.
a  The extremists wanted a guarantee that the four Calcutta resolutions will be passed.
o  They objected to the duly elected president of the year, Rash Behari Ghose. a  There was a 
confrontation with hurling of chairs and shoes.
•  The government launched a massive attack on the extremists. Newspapers were suppressed. Tilak 
was sent to Mandalay jail for six years.

•  The extremists were not able to organize an effective alternative party or to sustain the 
movement.

• After 1908 the national movement as a whole declined.

•  The moderates and the country as a whole were disappointed by the 1909 Minto-Morley reforms

o The number of indirectly elected members of the Imperial and provincial legislative councils was 
increased.
o Separate electorates for Muslims were introduced.

• With the split of Congress revolutionary terrorism rose.

• In 1904 V D Savarkar organized Abhinav Bharat as a secret society of revolutionaries

•  In April 1908, Prafulla Chaki and Khudiram Bose threw a bomb at a carriage which they believed 
was occupied by Kingsford the unpopular judge at Muzzafarpur.

• Anushilan Samity and Jugantar were two most important revolutionary groups.

   
   


 

• An assessment of the split
o The split did not prove useful to either party
a  The British played the game of divide and rule
o  To placate the moderates they announced the Morley-Minto reforms which did not satisfy the 
demands of the nationalists. They also annulled the partition of Bengal in 1911.
Morley-Minto Reforms, 1909

•  Increased the number of elected members in the Imperial Legislative Council and the provincial 
council

• However, most of the elected members were elected indirectly

• The reformed councils still enjoyed no real power, being merely advisory bodies.

•  Introduced separate electorates under which all Muslims were grouped in separate constituencies 
from which Muslims alone could be elected. This was aimed at dividing the Hindus and Muslims. It 
was based on the notion that the political and economic interests of Hindus and Muslims were 
separate.
o This later became a potent factor in the growth of communalism

o It isolated the Muslims from the Nationalist Movement and encouraged separatist tendencies

•  The real purpose of the reforms was to confuse the moderate nationalists, to divide nationalist 
ranks and to check the growth of unity among Indians

• Response of Moderates
o They realized that the reforms had not granted much
o However, they decided to cooperate with the government in working the reforms
o This led to their loss of respect among the nationalists and masses Growth of Communalism
• Definition
o  Communalism is the belief that because a group of people follow a particular religion they have, 
as a result, common secular, that is, social, political and economic interests.

a  Second stage: Secular interests of followers of one religion are dissimilar and divergent from 
the interests of the followers of another religion

a  Third stage: The interests of the followers of different religions or of different religious 
communities are seen to be mutually incompatible, antagonistic and hostile.

   
   


 

•  Communalism is not a remnant of the medieval period. It has its roots in the modern colonial 
socio-economic political structure.

•  Divide and Rule
a  After 1857, British initially suppressed Indian muslims. However, after the publishing of 
Hunter's book ‘The Indian Mussalman' they actively followed the policy of divide and rule and hence 
started supporting the Muslims.
o They promoted provincialism by talking of Bengal domination
a  Tired to use the caste structure to turn the non-brahmins against Brahmins and the lower caste 
against the higher castes.

a  It readily accepted communal leaders as authentic representatives of all their co-religionists.

• Reasons for growth of communal tendencies in Muslims

a  Relative backwardness: educationally and economically <incompIete>

Muslim League

•  1906 by Aga Khan, the Nawab of Dhaka, and Nawab Mohsin-uI-Mulk

•  It made no critique of colonialism, supported the partition of Bengal and demanded special 
safeguards for the Muslims in government services.

• ML's political activities were directed not against the foreign rulers but against the Hindus and 
the INC.

•  Their activities were not supported by all Muslims
o  Arhar movement was founded at this time under the leadership of Maulana Mohamed Ali, Hakim Ajmal 
Khan, Hasan Imam, Maulana Zafar Ali Khan, and Mazhar- uI-Haq. They advocated participation in the 
militant nationalist movement.
Muslim Nationalists

• The war between Ottoman Empire and Italy created a wave of sympathy for Turkey

•  During the war between Ottoman empire and Italy, India sent a medical mission headed by MA 
Ansari to help Turkey.

•  As the British were not sympathetic to Turkey, the pro-CaIiph sentiments in India became 
anti-British

•  However, the militant nationalists among muslims did not accept an entirely secular approach to 
politics

•  The most important issue they took up was not political independence but protection of the 
Turkish empire.


   
   


 

•  This approach did not immediately clash with Indian nationalism. However, in the long run it 
proved harmful as it encouraged the habit of looking at political questions from a religious view 
point.
Hindu Communalism

•  Some Hindus accepted the colonial view of Indian history and talked about the tyrannical Muslim 
rule in the medieval period

• Over language they said that Hindi was the language of Hindus and Urdu that of Muslims.

•  Punjab Hindu Sabha was founded in 1909. Its leaders attached the INC for trying to unite Indians 
into a single nation.

•  The first session of the All India Hindu Mahasabha was held in April 1915 under the 
presidentship of the Maharaja of Kasim Bazar.

•  It however remained a weak organization because the colonial government gave it few concessions 
and little support.


CHAPTER 12: World War I and Indian Nationalism

• Increasing number of Indians from Punjab were emigrating to North America.

•  The British government thought that these emigrants would be affected by the idea of liberty. 
Hence, they tried to restrict emigration.

•  Tarak Nath Das, an Indian student in Canada, started a paper called Free Hindustan.

•  The Hindi Association was setup in Portland in May 1913.

•  Under the leadership of Lala Har Dayal, a weekly paper, The Ghadar was started and a 
headquarters called Yugantar Ashram was set up in San Fransisco.

•  On November 1, 1913, the first issue of Ghadar was published in Urdu and on December 9, the 
Gurumukhi edition.

• In 1914, three events influenced the course of the Ghadar movement: o The arrest and escape of 
Har Dayal
a  The Komagata Maru incident
o Outbreak of the first world war

•  Gharadites came to India and made several attempts to instill the Indian population to revolt. 
However, this was of no avail.

•  The Ghadar movement was very secular in nature.

• Ghadar militants were distinguished by their secular, egalitarian, democratic and non- 
chauvinistic internationalist outlook.

   
   


 

•  The major weakness of the Ghadar leaders was that they completely under-estimated the extent and 
amount of preparation at every level — organizational, ideological, strategic, tactical, financial 
— that was necessary before an attempt at an armed revolt could be organized.

•  It also failed to generate an effective and sustained leadership that was capable of integrating 
the various aspects of the movement.

• Another weakness was its almost non-existent organizational structure.

•  Some important leaders: Baba Gurmukh Singh, Kartar Singh Saraba, Sohan Singh Bhakna, Rahmat Ali 
Shah, Bhai Parmanand and Mohammad Barkatullah.

•  Inspired by the Ghadar Party, 700 soldiers at Singapore revolted under the leadership of Jamadar 
Chisti Khan and Subedar Dundey Khan. The rebellion was crushed.

•  Other revolutionaries: Jatin Mukharjee, Rash Bihari Bose, Raja Mahendra Pratab, Lala Hardayal, 
Abdul Rahim, Maulana Obaidullah Sindhi, Champakaraman Pillai, Sardar Singh Rana and Madame Cama


CHAPTER 13: The Home Rule Movement

•  After being released in 1914, Tilak sought re-entry into Congress. Annie Besant and Gokhale 
supported. But finally Pherozshah Mehta won and Tilak was not admitted.

•  Tilak and Besant decided to start the home rule movement on their own.

•  In early 1915, Annie Besant (and S Subramaniya lyer) launched a campaign through her two 
newspapers, New India and Commonweal, and organized public meetings and conferences to demand that 
India be granted self-government on the lines of the White colonies after the War. From April 1915, 
her tone became more peremptory and her stance more aggressive.

•  At the annual session of the Congress in December 1915 it was decided that the extremists be 
allowed to rejoin the Congress. The opposition from the Bombay group has been greatly weakened by 
the death of Pherozshah Mehta.

•  Tilak and Annie Besant set up two different home rule leagues.

•  Tilak's league was to work in Maharashtra (excluding Bombay city), Karnataka, the central 
provinces and Berar and Annie Besant's league was given the charged of the rest of India.

•  Tilak was totally secular in nature. There was no trace of religious appeal. The demand for Home 
Rule was made on a wholly secular basis.
a  “Home rule is my birthright, and I will have it"

•  The British were aliens not because they belonged to another religion but because they did not 
act in the Indian interest


   
   


 

•  Tilak's league was organized into six branches, one each in Central Maharashtrra, Bombay city, 
Karnataka, and Central Provinces, and two in Berar.

•  On 07/23/1916, on Tilak's sixtieth birthday the government sent a notice asking him to show 
cause why he should not be bound over for good behavior for a period of one year and demanding 
securities of Rs 60000

•  Tilak was defended by a team of lawyers led by Mohammad Ali Jinnah. He won. Tilak used the 
opportunity to further the Home Rule movement.

•  In Besant's league, the main thrust of activity was directed towards building up an agitation 
around the demand for Home Rule. This was to be achieved by promoting political education and 
discussion.

•  Lucknow Pact: 1916 in the Congress Session at Lucknow. Also known as Congress League Pact. 
Extremists were accepted back in congress. An agreement was reached between Muslim League and 
Congress.

•  The turning point in the movement came with the arrest of Annie Besant in June 1917

•  There was wide agitation and many leaders joined the league.

•  The government agreed to grant self rule but the timing for such a change was to be decided by 
the government alone.

•  After the great advance in 1917, the movement gradually dissolved.
a  The moderates were pacified by the government's assurance of reforms after Besant's release.

a  The publication of scheme of government reforms in July 1918 further created divisions. Many 
rejected it while others were for giving it a trial.

a  Later, Tilak went to England to fight a case. With Besant unable to give a firm lead, and Tilak 
away in England, the movement was left leaderless.

• Achievements of the movement
o  The achievement of the Home Rule movement was that it created a generation of ardent 
nationalists who formed the backbone of the national movement in the coming years.
o  The Home rule leagues also created organizational links between town and country which were to 
prove invaluable in later years.

o By popularizing the idea of self-government, it generated a widespread pro- nationalist 
atmosphere in the country.

o The movement set the right mood for the entry of Mahatma Gandhi and take the leadership.

Lucknow Pact (1916)

• Nationalists saw that their disunity was affecting their cause
   
   


 

•  Two important developments at the Lucknow Session of Congress o The two wings of the Congress 
were again united
a  The Congress and the Muslim League sank their old differences and put up common political 
demands before the government.

•  INC and ML passed the same resolutions at their sessions, put forward a joint scheme of 
political reforms based on separate electorates, and demanded that the British Government should 
make a declaration that it would confer self-government on India at an early date.

•  The pact accepted the principle of separate electorates

• Main clauses of the pact

o There shall be self-government in India.
o  Muslims should be given one-third representation in the central government.
o  There should be separate electorates for all the communities until a community demanded joint 
electorates.
o A system of weightage should be adopted.
o  The number of the members of Central Legislative Council should be increased to 150.
o  At the provincial level, four-fifth of the members of the Legislative Councils should be elected 
and one-fifth should be nominated.
o  The size of provincial legislatures should not be less than 125 in the major provinces and from 
50 to 75 in the minor provinces.
o  All members, except those nominated, should be elected directly on the basis of adult franchise.
o  No bill concerning a community should be passed if the bill is opposed by three-fourth of the 
members of that community in the Legislative Council.
o  The term of the Legislative Council should be five years.
o  Members of Legislative Council should themselves elect their president.
o  Half of the members of Imperial Legislative Council should be Indians.
o The Indian Council must be abolished.
o  The salaries of the Secretary of State for Indian Affairs should be paid by the British 
government and not from Indian funds.
o  Of the two Under Secretaries, one should be Indian.
o  The Executive should be separated from the Judiciary.
• Evaluation
a  As an immediate effect, the unity between the two factions of the congress and between INC and 
ML aroused great political enthusiasm in the country
a  However, it did not involve Hindu and Muslim masses and was based on the notion of bringing 
together the educated Hindus and Muslims as separate political entities without secularization of 
their political outlook

o  The pact therefore left the way open to the future resurgence of communalism in Indian politics.

•  Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms

   
   


 

o Provincial LC enlarged. More elected members
o Dyarchy
•  Some subjects were reserved and remained under the direct control of the Governor; others such 
as education, public health and local self-government were called transferred subjects and were to 
be controlled by the ministers responsible to the legislature.
o At the centre, there were two houses of legislature.
o Response of nationalists
•  INC condemned the reforms as disappointing and unsatisfactory

•  Some others , led by Surendranath Banerjea, were in favour of accepting the government 
proposals. They left the Congress at this time and founded the Indian Liberal Federation
a  Evaluation

•  The governor could overrule the ministers on any grounds that he considered special
•  The legislature had virtually no control over the Governor-General and his Executive Council.

•  The central government had unrestricted control over the provincial governments


Rowlatt Act

• March 1919

• It authorized the Government to imprison any person without trial and conviction in a court of 
law.


CHAPTER 14: Gandhi's early career and activism

•  Gandhi was the first Indian barrister to have come to South Africa.

•  He was faced with various racial discriminations within days of his arrival in SA.

•  He led the Indian struggle in SA.

•  The first phase of Gandhi's political activities from 1894-1906 may be classified as the 
’moderate’ phase.

•  He set up the Natal Indian Congress and started a paper called Indian Opinion.


   
   


 

• By 1906, Gandhiji, having fully tried the ’Moderate’ methods of struggle, was becoming convinced 
that these would not lead anywhere.

•  The second phase, begun in 1906, was characterized by the use of passive resistance, Satyagraha. 
There was no fear of jails.

•  South Africa prepared Gandhiji for leadership of the Indian national struggle: a  He had the 
invaluable experience of leading poor Indian labourers.
a  SA built up his faith in the capacity of the Indian masses to participate in and sacrifice for a 
cause that moved them.
a  Gandhiji also had the opportunity of leading Indians belonging to different religions.

•  South Africa provided Gandhiji with an opportunity for evolving his own style of politics and 
leadership.
•  Gandhi returned to India on 01/09/1915
•  He founded the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad in 1916
• Initially he was politically idle. He spent his time studying the situation of the country.
•  He was deeply convinced that the only viable method of political struggle was satyagraha.
• During the course of 1917 and early 1918, he was involved in three significant struggles
— in Champaran in Bihar, in Ahmedabad and in Kheda in Gujarat. The common feature of these 
struggles was that they related to specific local issues and that they were fought for the economic 
demands of the masses.
• Champaran Satyagraha (1917)
a  Peasantry on the indigo plantations in Champaran, Bihar was excessively oppressed by the 
Eurpoean planters.
a  On the invitation of the peasants he went to Champaran and began to conduct a detailed inquiry 
into the condition of the peasantry
o  The government was forced to set up a committee with Gandhi as one of the members. The 
sufferings of the peasants was reduced.
o Others in this movement: Rajendra Prasad, Mazhar-ul-Haq, J B Kriplani, Narhari Parekh and Mahadev 
Desai.
• Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918)
a  Dispute between workers and mill owners
o Gandhi advised workers to go on a non-violent strike. He himself took to fast a  Owners yielded 
and gave a 35 percent increase in wages to the workers
• Kheda Satyagraha (1918)
a  Despite crop failure in Kheda the government insisted on full land revenue
o Gandhi advised the peasants to withhold payment.
a  Govt issued instructions that revenue should be collected from only those farmers who could 
afford to pay
a  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played a major role in this satyagraha.
• Impact of these early experiences
a  Brought Gandhiji in close contact with the masses
o He identified his life and manner of living with the life of the common people
•  He had three main aims

   
   


 

o Hindu-Muslim Unity
a  Fight against untouchability
o Raising the social status of the women
•  Gandhiji's first major nation-wide protest was against the Rowlatt Bills in 1919. He formed the 
Satyagraha Sabha whose members took a pledge to disobey the Act and thus to court arrest and 
imprisonment.
•  Satyagraha was launched. The form of protest finally decided was the observance of a nation-wide 
hartal accompanied by fasting and prayer.
• However, protests were generally accompanied by violence and disorder.
•  In Punjab, the situation was particularly violent. Genral Dyer was called to control the 
situation. On 13 April, Baisakhi Day, General Dyer ordered to open fire on unarmed crowd in 
Jallianwala Bagh. The government estimate was 379 dead, other estimates were considerably higher.
•  Gandhiji, overwhelmed by the total atmosphere of violence, withdrew the movement on 18 April.
• Difference between earlier methods of struggle and satyagraha
a  Earlier, the movement had confined its struggle to agitation. They used to hold meetings, 
demonstrate, boycott etc
a  Through Satyagraha they could act now.
o  The new movement relied increasingly on the political support of the peasants, artisans and 
urban poor.
o Gandhiji increasingly turned the face of nationalism towards the common man
• Jallianwala Bagh Massacre
o On 04/13/1919 a large crowd had gathered in Amritsar to protest against the arrest of their 
leaders, Dr. Saifudding Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal
o General Dyer opened fire
a  Widespread criticism. Tagore returned his knighthood.



CHAPTER 15: Non Co-operation Movement

•  Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms 1919: Dyarchy

•  In a system called "dyarchy," the nation-building departments of government — agriculture, 
education, public works, and the like — were placed under ministers who were individually 
responsible to the legislature. The departments that made up the "steel frame" of British rule — 
finance, revenue, and home affairs — were retained by executive councillors who were nominated by 
the Governor.

• The Hunter Committee report praised the actions of general Dyer.

• Khilafat Movement
o For support of Turkey
o Khilafat Committee formed under the leadership of Ali Brothers, Maulana Azad,
Hakim Ajmal Khan and Hasrat Mohani
o The promises made to the Khilafat Committee were not kept after the World War.

   
   


 

o The All-India Khilafat Conference held at Delhi in November 1919 decided to withdraw all 
cooperation from the government if their demands were not met.

o On 06/09/1920, the Khilafat Committee at Allahabad unanimously accepted the suggestion of 
non-cooperation and asked Gandhiji to lead the movement.

• Khilafat movement cemented Hindu-Muslim unity
o  Gandhiji looked upon the Khilafat agitation as “an opportunity of uniting Hindus and Mohammedans 
as would not arise in a hundred years”

•  The non-cooperation movement was launched on 01/08/1920. Lokmanya Tilak passed away on the 
same day.

• People countrywide observed hartal and took out processions.

• The congress met in September at Calcutta and accepted non-co-operation as its own.

•  The programme of non-cooperation included:
o Surrender of titles and honors
a  Boycott of government affiliated schools and colleges, law courts, foreign cloth and could be 
extended to resignation from government services.
a  Mass civil disobedience including the non-payment of taxes.
o National schools and colleges were to be set up
a  Panchayats were to be established to settle disputes
o Hand-spinning and weaving was encouraged
o People were asked to maintain Hindu-Muslim unity, give up untouchability and observe strict 
non-violence.

• Changes in Congress to attain the new objective:
o At the Nagpur session in 1920 changes in the Constitution of Congress were made.

o  The goal of congress was changed from the attainment of self-government by constitutional and 
legal means to the attainment of Swaraj by peaceful and legitimate means.
o The Congress now had a Working Committee of fifteen members to look after its day to day affairs.
a  Provincial congress committees were now organized on a linguistic basis.
o Mahalla and ward committees were formed.
a  The membership fee was reduced to 4 annas a years to enable poor to become members.


   
   


 

o  This was not without opposition however. Some members still believed in the traditional methods. 
Leaders like Jinnah, GS Khaparde, Bipin Chandra Pal and Annie Besant left congress during this 
time.

• Gandhiji, along with the Ali brother, undertook a nationwide tour to address people.

• Thousands of students left government schools and joined national schools.

• The most successful item of the programme was the boycott of foreign cloth.

• Picketing of toddy shops was also very popular.

•  Students let government schools and colleges. IT was during this time that Jamia Milia Islamia 
of Aligarh, the Bihar Vidyapith, the Kashi Vidyapith and the Gujarat Vidyapith came into existence.

•  Lawyers such as Deshbandhu CR Das, Motilal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Saifudiin Kitchlew, C 
Rajagopalachari, Sardar Patel, T Prakasam and Asaf Ali gave up their legal practice.

•  Tilak Swarajya Fund was started to finance the NCM.

•  In 1921, Khilafat Committee issued a resolution that no muslim should serve in the British 
Indian army.

• The visit of the Prince of Wales on 17/11/1921 was observed as a day of hartal all over 
the country.

• The Congress Volunteer Corps emerged as a powerful parallel police.

•  By December 1921, the government felt that things were going too far and announced a change of 
policy by declaring the volunteer corps illegal and arresting all those who claimed to be its 
members.

• Thousands of peasants and tenants participated in the movement.

•  In Punjab, the Akali movement to remove corrupt mahants from the Gurudwaras was started.

• Assam: Tea plantation workers went on strike. Midnapore: peasants refused to pay Union Board 
taxes.  Guntur (Chirala): Agitation led by Duggirala Gopalakrishayya
Malabar: Mohlahs (muslim peasants) created a powerful anti-zamindari movement.

•  As the government refused to yield, Gandhiji announced that mass civil disobedience would begin 
in Bardoli taluqa of Surat.

•  However, in Chauri Chaura, Gorakhpur on 05/02/1922 crowd set fire on a police station and 
killed some policemen. On hearing this, Gandhiji decided to withdraw the movement.

•  The congress working committee ratified his decision. Thus, on 02/12/1922, the non- 
cooperation movement came to an end.

• Assessing the Withdrawal:


   
   


 

o Some scholars say that Gandhiji withdrew the movement because he wanted to protect the interests 
of the propertied class.

o  Some argue that there was no logic why a small incident should lead to withdrawal of the 
movement itself.

o However, government could use Chauri Chaura to justify its repression of the movement.
o  If movement was started at that time, it would have been defeated due to the repression of the 
government.
o Gandhiji was protecting the movement from likely repression, and the people from demoralization.

o Mass movements tend to ebb in some time. Hence, withdrawal is a part of the strategy of mass 
movements.

•  Gandhiji was tried in 1922 and sentenced to six years' imprisonment.
o He invited the court to award him “the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in 
law is a deliberate crime, and what appears to be the highest duty of a citizen".

• Positives out of the non-cooperation movement:

o Congress started commanding the support and sympathy of vast sections of the Indian people.

o Millions of Indians became politically involved. Women were drawn into the movement.

o Muslims participated heavily and communal unity was maintained.

o Strengthened the national movement. Nationalist sentiments and the national movement had reached 
the remotest corners of the land.o People gained tremendous self-confidence and self-esteem.
CHAPTER 16: Peasant Movements
• Three important peasant movements of the early twentieth century:
o Kisan Sabha and Eka movements in Avadh in UP
o Mappila rebellion in Malabar
o Bardoli Satyagrah in Gujarat
•  The UP Kisan Sabha was set up in February 1918 through the efforts of Gauri Shankar Mishra and 
Indra Narain Dwivedi with the support of Madan Mohan Malviya.
• By June 1919, it had established about 450 branches in 173 tehsils of the province.
• In August 1921, Mappila (Muslim) tenants rebelled. Their grievances related to lack of any 
security of tenure, renewal fees, high rents and other oppressive labndlord exactions.
• The no-tax movement was launched in Bardoli taluq of Surat district in Gujarat in 1928.
CHAPTER 17: The Working Class Movements
•  There were some working class movements in second half of 19ᵗʰ century. However, they were 
impulsive and not very well organized.
•  The early nationalists had a lukewarm attitude towards the question of workers. This war because 
initially Congress wanted to focus on issues which were of common concern to all the people of 
India.
•  There was a difference in attitude of the nationalists towards workers in indigenous and 
European enterprises.
•  The most important feature of the labour movement during the Swadeshi days was the shift from 
agitation and struggles on purely economic questions to the involvement of the worker with the 
wider political issues of the day.
•  The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) was founded in 1920.
• IN 1918 Gandhi founded the Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association.
•  The AITUC in November 1927 took a decision to boycott the Simon Commission and many workers 
participated in the massive Simon boycott demonstrations.
•  Alarmed by worker's movement, the government enacted repressive laws like the Public Safety Act 
and Trade Disputes Acts and arrested the entire radical leadership of the labour movement and 
launched the Meerut Conspiracy Case against them.
•  The labour movement suffered a major setback partially due to this government offensive and 
partially due to a shift in stance of the communist led wing of the movement.
• From the end of 1928, the communists stopped aligning them with the national movement.
• Communists got isolated within the AITUC and were thrown out in the split of 1931.
• BY 1934, the communists re-entered the mainstream nationalist politics.
•  The working class of Bombay held an anti-war strike on 02/10/1939.
•  With the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, the communists changed their policy and asked 
the people to support the allied forces instead of holding anti-war strikes.
•  The communists dissociated themselves from the Quit India movement launched in 1942.
•  The last years of colonial rule also saw a remarkably sharp increase in strikes on economic 
issues all over the country — the all India strike of the post and telegraph department employees 
being the most well known among them.
CHAPTER 18: Struggles for Gurudwara Reform and Temple Entry
• The Akali movement
•  The movement arose with the objective of freeing the Gurudwaras from the control of ignorant and 
corrupt priests (mahants).
•  Apart from the mahants, after the British annexation of Punjab in 1849, some control over the 
Gurudwaras was exercised by Government-nominated managers and custodians, who often collaborated 
with mahants.
•  The government gave full support to the mahants. It used them to preach loyalism to the Sikhs 
and to keep them away from the rising nationalist movement.
•  The agitation for the reform of Gurudwaras developed during 1920 when the reformers organized 
groups of volunteers known as jathas to compel the mahants and the government appointed managers to 
hand over control of the Gurudwaras to the local devotees.
•  Tens of Gurudwaras were liberated within an year.
•  To manage the control of Golden Temple and othe rGurudwaras the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak 
Committee was formed in November 1920.
• Feeling the need to give the reform movement a structure, the Shiromani Akali Dal was established 
in December 1920.
• The SGPC and Akali Dal accepted complete non-violence as their creed.
•  There was a clash between the mahant and the Akalis over surrendering the gurudwara at Nanakana. 
This led to killing of about 100 akalis.
•  The Nankana tragedy led to the involvement of Sikhs on a large scale in the national movement.
•  Keys Affair: In October 1921, the government refused to surrender the possession fo the keys of 
the Toshakhana of the golden temple of the Akalis. This led to protests. Leaders like Baba Kharak 
Singh and Master Tara Singh were arrested. Later, the government surrendered the keys to keep the 
Sikhs from revolting.
•  Guru ka Bagh gurudwara in Ghokewala was under dispute as the mahant there claimed that the land 
attached to it was his personal possession. When few akalis cut down a tree on that land they were 
arrested on the complain of the mahant. Seeing this thousands of akalis came and started cutting 
down the trees. About 4000 akalis were arrested. Later, the government didn't arrest but started 
beating them up severly. But the alakis kept turning up. Ultimately the government had to 
surrender.
• The akali movement made a huge contribution to the national awakening of Punjab.
•  However, the movement encouraged a certain religiosity which would be later utilized by 
communalism.
• In 1923, the Congress decided to take active steps towards the eradication of untouchability.
• The basic strategy it adopted was to educate and mobilize opinion among caste hindus.
•  Immediately after the Kakinada session, the Kerala Provincial Congress Committee (KPCC) took up 
the eradication of untouchability as an urgent issue.
•  KPCC adeiced to organize an procession on the temple roads in Vaikom, a village in Travancore, 
on 30/03/1924.
• During the processions, the satyagrahis were arrested and sentenced to imprisonment.
• On the death of Maharaja in August 1924, the Maharani released the Satyagrahis.
•  Gandhiji visited Kerala to discuss the opening of temple with Maharani. A compromise was reached 
whereby all roads except for the ones in the Sankethan of the temple were opened to the harijans.
• In his Kerala tour, Gandhi didn't visit a single temple because avarnas were kept out of them.
•  The weakness of the anti-caste movement was that through it aroused people against 
untouchability it lacked a strategy of ending the caste system itself.
CHAPTER 19: The years of Stagnation
•  Gandhiji was arrested in 1922 and sentenced to 6 years of imprisonment. The result was the 
spread of disintegration, disorganization and demoralization in the nationalist ranks.
•  After a defeat of their resolution of ‘either mending or ending’ in the Congress, CR Das and 
Motilal Nehru resigned and formed the Congress-Khilafat Swaraj Party in December 1922.
o It was to function as a group within the congress
•  How to carry on political work in the movements’ non-active phases. The swarajists said that 
work in the council was necessary to fill the temporary political void. The no-changers believed 
otherwise.
• Major no-changers: Sardar Patel, Dr Ansari, Rajendra Prasad
•  The no-changers opposed council-entry mainly on the ground that parliamentary work would lead to 
the neglect of constructive and other work among the masses , the loss of revolutionary zeal and 
political corruption.
•  Despite the differences, he two groups had a lot in common.
o The need for unity was very strongly felt by all the Congressmen after the 1907 debacle.
a  Both realized that the real sanctions which would compel the government to accept the national 
demands would be forged only by a mass movement.
a  Both groups fully accepted the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.
•  In the session held in 1923, the congressmen were permitted to stand as candidates and exercise 
their franchise in the forthcoming elections.
•  Gandhiji was released on 05/02/1924. He did not agree with the Swarajists. However, slowly 
he moved towards an accommodation with the swarajists.
•  On 06/11/1924, Gandhiji brought the strife between the Swarajists and no-changers to an 
end, by signing a joint statement with Das and Motilal that the Swarajists Party would carry on 
work in the legislatures on behalf of the Congress and as an integral part of the Congress. This 
decision was endorsed in Belgaum.
•  The Swarajists did well in the elections and won 42 out of 101 seats in the Central Legislative 
Assembly.
• In March 1925, Vithalbhai J Patel was elected as he President (speaker) of the Central 
Legislative Assembly.
•  The achievement of the Swarajists lay in filling the political void at a time when the national 
movement was recouping its strength.
o They also exposed the hollowness of the reforms of 1919
• After the petering out of the NCM communalism took stronghold
o  Even within the Congress, a group known as ‘responsivists’, including Madan Mohan Malviya, Lala 
Lajpat Rai and NC Kelkar, offered cooperation to the government so that the so-called Hindu 
interests might be safeguarded.

CHAPTER 20: Bhagat Singh

•  The sudden suspension of the non-cooperation movement led many young people to question the very 
basis strategy of non-violence and began to look for alternatives.
•  All the major new revolutionary leaders had been enthusiastic participants in the non- violent 
non-cooperation movement.
•  Two separate strands of revolutionary terrorism developed — one in Punjab, UP and Bihar and the 
other in Bengal.
• Ramprasad Bismil, Jogesh Chatterjea and Sachindranath Sanyal met in Kanpur in October 1924 and 
founded the Hindustan Republican Association to organize armed revolution.

   
   


 

•  In order to carry out their activities the HRA required funding. The most important action of 
the HRA was the Kakori Robbery.
•  On August 9, 1925, ten men held up the 8-Down train from Shahjahanpur to Lucknow at Kakori and 
looted its official railway cash.
•  The government arrested a large number of young men and tried them in the Kakori Conspiracy 
Case.
•  Ashfaqulla Khan, Ramprasadn Bismil, Roshan Singh and Rajendra Lahiri were hanged, four others 
were sent to Andaman while seventeen others were sentenced to long term imprisonment.
•  New revolutionaries joined the HRA. They met at Ferozshah Kotla Ground at Delhi on 9 and 10 
September 1928, created a new collective leadership, adopted socialism as their official goal and 
changed the name of the party to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association.
•  Lala Lajpat Rai dies in a lathi-charge when he was laeding an anti-Simon Commission 
demonstration at Lahore on 30 October 1928.
•  On 17 December 1928, Bhagat Singh, Azad and Rajguru assassinated, at Lahore, Saunders, a police 
official involved in the lathi-charge on Lala Lajpat Rai.
•  In order to let the people know about HSRA's changed objectives Bhagat Singh and BK Dutt were 
asked to throw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly on 8 April 1929 against the passage of 
the Public Safety Bill and the Trade Disputes Bill.
•  He aim was not to kill but to let people know of their objectives through the leaflet they 
threw.
•  They were later arrested and tried.
•  The country was also stirred by the hunger strike the revolutionaries took as a protest against 
the horrible conditions in jails.
•  On 13'ʰ September, the 64*ʰ day of the epic fast, Jatin Das died.
•  Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were sentenced to be hanged. He sentence was carried out on 23 
March, 1931.
•  Bhagat Singh was fully secular.
o The Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha organized by him acted on secular lines.
•  In Bengal, after the death of C R Das, the Congress leadership in Bengal got divided into two 
wings: one led by S C Bose and the other by J M Sengupta. The Yugantar group joined forces with the 
first while the Anushilan with the second.
•  Surya Sen had actively participated in the non-cooperation movement. He gathered around him a 
large band of revolutionary youth including Anant Singh, Ganesh Ghosh and Lokenath Baul.
•  Chittagong Armoury Raid

• NEHRU REPORT (1928) & FOURTEEN POINTS (1929)
•  Background — 7here was a longstanding demand on the port o( people of India to new constitution 
and their greater say in its dra(ting. The report was an attempt to address this need for a new 
constitution. Lord Birkenhead had challenged Indians to produce an agreed constitution. This report 
came in that background.
•  The ‘Nehru Report’ (1928) was a memorandum outlining a proposed new Dominionconstitution (it was 
an outline and not a constitution itself) for India. It was prepared by a committee of the All 
Parties Conference chaired by Motilal Nehru with his son Jawaharlal acting as secretary. There were 
nine other members in this committee including two Muslims.
•  The report didn't seek complete independence but, the constitution outlined by the Nehru report 
was for India enjoying dominion status within the British Commonwealth. Motilal commented — ‘It's 
on achievement on which any countrY in the world wight well be proud

•  Recommendations —
•  I. It called for Dominion Status
•  II. Unlike the eventual Government of India Act 1935 it contained a Bill o( Rights.
•  III. It did not provide (or separate electorates for any community or weightage for minorities.
•  IV. It advocated (ederal structure.
•  V. Seperation of state from religion
•  VI. A parliamentary form o( Government
•  VII. Residual powers with (ederal/central government
•  VIII. Adu/t (ranchise
•  IX. Redistribution o( provincial boundries on a linguistic basis

•  Most of its recommendations formed the basis of constitution of independent India.
•  Controversies over report -
•  I. It did away with Communal/Separate Electorate — this attracted much ire from Muslim league 
and other minority communities
•  II. It asked for Dominion Status and not complete Independence — On this issue, even Jawahar Lal 
differed with his father (which was reflected a year later when he came up with a demand for Purna 
Swaraj). Nehru and Subhash formed ‘Independence for India League’.

•  Neither Muslim League nor Hindu Mahasabha nor ardent Sikhs agreed with the report and it set the 
stage for the communal confrontation.
•  FOURTEEN POINTS, 1929



   
   


 

•  With few exceptions League leaders rejected the Nehru proposals.They objected the provision o( 
single e/ectorote and wanted separate electorate. They also saw residual powers I federal










































   
   


 

•  structure with center as unacceptable as they were not in majority at national level and feared 
that this provision can be misused.
•  In reaction, Mohammad Ali Jinnah drafted his Fourteen Points in 1929 which became the core 
demands the Muslim community put forward as the price of their participating in an independent 
united India.
•  Main points of 14 Point Formula were —
• I. Separate electorate
• II. 33% seats reserved for Muslims in Central Legislatures
• III. Residual powers vested with provinces
•  IV. Provincial autonomy
•  V. No constitutional amendment by the by the center without the concurrence of the states 
constituting the federation.
• VI. Adequate representation of Muslims in services
•  VII. Full religious {reedom to all communities

•  However, Gandhi and a few others also, didn't support the separate electorate for Muslim or 
Dalits as he saw it divisive and perpetuating the divide that exist.
•  Over Dominion status, Candhiji and Motilo/ argued that consensus over it has been built bYsreat 
efforts and 2 Years should be given to see government response. After negotiations this time was 
reduced to 1 year and it was decided that if Dominion Status was not realized during this period a 
demand for full independence will be made and Civil Disobedience will be launched.
•  In 1929, just before demand for Poorna Swaraj, in an effort to win them over, the viceroy, Lord 
Irwin, announced in October 1929, a vague offer ot ‘dominion status’ for India in an unspecified 
future, and a Round Table Conference to discuss a future constitution. This did not satisfy the 
Congress leaders.
• RISE OF RADICALS, DEMAND for PURNA SWARAJ (1929)
•  Background — Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and Satyamurti became more assertive after 
the Nehru Report which defied their expectations by announcing Dominion Status as their demand. 
However, Motilal Nehru and Gandhi were reluctant to shed the gains they have made by demanding 
Dominion Status and they demanded to give a 1 year's time to government. But British didn't relent. 
There was some hope after the new Labor government was elected in 1929 (headed by Ramsay McDonald) 
and new Secretary of State ‘Wedgewood Benn’ was also sympathetic to Indian cause. Viceroy Irwin too 
raised some hope among likes of Motilal and Gandhi when hinted towards Dominion Staus (which was, 
however, not confirmed) a round table talk for the same. This, however, didn't assuage the 
sentiments of neither liberals nor Jawahar Lal and others.
•  In December 1929, under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru, the Lahore Congress formalized the 
demand of ‘Purna Swaraj’ or full independence for India. Jawahar unfurled Indian flag at the bank 
o(








   
   


 

• Ravi on midnight o{ 31st Oecember. He declared - ‘It's a crime against man and God to
submit a•Y longer'.
• Following broad decisions were taken —
•  l. Boycott o( Round Table Conference
•  II. Demand for Poorna Swaraj
•  III. All members o( legislature may resign.
•  IV. It was declared that 26 January 1930, would be celebrated as the Independence Day when 
people were to take a pledge to struggle for complete independence. Lahore session also marked a 
leadership shift to younger generation.
•  V. It was also decided that a Civil Disobedient movement will be launched under leadership of 
Gandhi

•  Call for nation wide meetings was made and it saw huge participation from both Rural and Urban 
areas and pledges were made for Purna Swaraj.
• GANDHI's 11 POINTS, SALT MARCH & CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT, 1930
•  Background — After non-action of government over Nehru Report and failure of government to agree 
upon any demand for even dominion status, Gandhiji was looking for a new plan amidst growing 
restlessness among the Congress and nation as a whole.
• Mahatma Gandhi found in salt a powerful symbol that could unite the nation. On 31 January 1930 — 
Soon after demand for Purna Swaraj, he sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin stating eleven demands (11 
points). In his letter to Viceroy he stated — ’British ru/e has impoverished ‘the Dumb Millions’ by 
6i system of progressive exploitation, reducing us to political serfdom and sapped us cu/turally, 
degraded us spiritU0!!y
•  Some of these were of general interest; others were specific demands of different classes, from 
industrialists to peasants. The idea was to make the demands wide-ranging, so that all classes 
within Indian society could identify with them and everyone could be brought together in a united 
campaign.
• These included among others —
• I. Total prohibition
•  II. Release of political prisioners
• III. Reduce expenditure on civil services and military
•  IV. Levy of duty on foreign cloth
• V. Issue of firearm licences
•  VI. Reduce land revenue by 50%
• VII. Reduce Rupee Sterling exchange ratio to make Indian exports profitable
• VIII. Reserve Coastal shipping for Indians
• IX. Abolition of Salt Tax.











   
   


 

•  The most stirring of all was the demand to abolish the salt tax. Salt was something consumed 
bYthe rich and the poor alike, and it was one o( the most essential items o{ food.The tax on salt 
and the government monopO!Yover its production, Mahatma candhi declared, revealed the most 
oppressive faceof British rule. Further, Salt Satyagraha had a potential of mass appeal and 
mass-involvement. Mahatma Gandhi's letter was, in a way, an ultimatum.
•  Indian reaction to proposed 11 Points —
•  I. There was some resentment among nationalist leaders over the 11 points as they sow it running 
counter the Swaraj Declaration that was made just some time back. However Gandhi wanted to see the 
sincerity f Brit/sh.
•  II. Industrial class whoIehearted!YSUpported Gandhian demands in (ull as they saw them more of 
economic nature (levy of duty on foreign cloth and other demands if would have been accepted would 
have promoted domestic indutry)

•  If the demands were not fulfilled by 11 March, the letter stated, the Congress would launch a 
civil disobedience campaign. Irwin was unwilling to negotiate and no-response was given to deamnds. 
Gandhi decided to go for Civil Disobedience. On this, Gandhi commented — ’While he asked (or the 
bread, he was given a stone'on the apathetic attitude of Viceroy and British government over their 
non-response to Gandhi's pleas before he started Civil Disobedience Movement.
•  So, Mahatma Gandhi started his famous salt march accompanied by 78 of his trusted volunteers 
which also included Sarojini Naidu. Congress vested in Gandhi power to launch Civil Disobedience 
Movment. The march was over 240 miles, from Gandhiji's ashram in Sabarmati to the Gujarati coastal 
town of Dandi. The volunteers walked for 24 days, about 10 miles a day. Thousands came to hear 
Mahatma Gandhi wherever he stopped, and he told them what he meant by swaraj and urged them to 
peacefully defy the British. On 6 April he reached Dandi, and ceremonially violated the law, 
manufacturing salt by boiling sea water. This marked the beginning o( the Civil Disobedience 
Movement.
•  Masses participated in the movement. Salt laws were broken everywhere. Even women participated 
in huge numbers. Kamla (wife of Nehru), Swarup Rani (Mother of Nehru) were at the forefront. In 
Tamil Nadu, C Rajagopalchari led the march, In Malabar K Kelappan took the lead.
•  Thousands in different parts of the country broke the salt law, manufactured salt and 
demonstrated in front of government salt factories. As the movement spread, foreign cloth was 
boycotted, and liquor shops were picketed. Peasants refused to pay revenue and chaukidari taxes, 
village officials resigned, and in many places forest people violated forest laws — going into 
Reserved Forests to collect wood and graze cattle.
• Other Impacts —
• I. There was a wide scale boYCOttof liquor shops and in protest toddy trees were cut down
•  II. Women participated at large scale for the first time
•  III. Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan launched a Khudai Khidmatgar Movement at the North West Frotnier 
Provinces









   
   


 


•  IV. Rani Gaidillieu at the age of 13 responded to Gandhian call in Manipur and was sentenced for 
life imprisionment and was released only in 1947
•  V. Chowkidar Tax Non-Pyment Campaign was initiated in the Eastern part of the nation (Chowkidars 
were hated with their pro-government activities and were even considered government spies).
• VI. Forest laws were liberally violated in Southern and Central provinces
•  VII. Bardoli Satyagraha was launched by Patel just before Civil Disobedience movement and it 
became a model no-tax campaign in other parts of the country during the Civil Disobedience 
movement.
•  VIII. UP saw another form of ‘No-Revenue, No Rent’ Campign. No-Revenue call was for Zamindars 
and they were asked not to pay revenue to government and No-rent call was for cultivators.
•  IX. A variety of mass mobilization techniques like Prabhat Pheris, Patrikas (illegal newsprint) 
were used. Children were organized into Vanar Sena and Girls into Manjari (cat) Sena.

•  Dharsana Satyagraha, 1930 - Dharasana Satyagraha was a protest against the British salt tax in 
colonial India in May, 1930. Following the conclusion of the Salt March to Dandi, Mahatma Gandhi 
chose a non-violent raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat as the next protest against British 
rule. Hundreds of satyagrahis were beaten by soldiers under British command at Dharasana. In a 
peaceful move led by Sarojini Naidu, (iles o( Satyagrahis (aced the lathis o( police and they te// 
in line, only to be replaced bY other line. The ensuing publicity attracted world attention to the 
Indian independence movement and brought into question the legitimacy of British rule in India.
•  British Response — Worried by the developments, the colonial government began arresting the 
Congress leaders one by one. This led to violent clashes in many palaces. A frightened government 
responded with a policy of brutal repression. Peaceful Satyagrahis were attacked, women and 
children were beaten, and about 60,000 people were arrested. Big leaders like C Rajagopalachari, 
Vallabhai, Jawahar, Madan Mohan Malviya, J M Sengupta etc were also arrested. Gandhi too was 
arrested in MaY J930 and leadership was transferred to Abbas Tyabji and he too was arrested. Later 
Sarojini took the lead, but she was also arrested. Government came up with many ‘repressive 
resolutions’, ‘Congress was declared i/legal’.
• Success of Movement -
•  It rallied masses like never before
•  Import of foreign goods was effectively boycotted
•  Students and Women participated in masses
•  Workers also joined the movement big time

• Failures of Movement -
•  Not all social groups were moved by the abstract concept of swaraj. One such group was the 
nation's ‘untouchables’, who from around the 1930s had begun to call themselves dalit or oppressed. 
For long the Congress had ignored the dalits, for fear of offending the sanatanis, the conservative 
high-caste Hindus. Dr B R Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed
• Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma Gandhi at the second Round Table Conference by 
demanding separate electorates for dalits.
•  Muslims — except in NWFP under Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan — show apathetic response. They were 
polarized by communal rhetorics of leaders as well as government's positive response
   
   


 

to their demands. After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat movement, a large section of 
Muslims felt alienated from the Congress. From the mid-1920s the Congress came to be more visibly 
associated with openly Hindu religious nationalist groups like the Hindu Mahasabha. As relations 
between Hindus and Muslims worsened, each community organised religious processions with militant 
fervour, provoking Hindu-Muslim communal clashes and riots in various cities.
•  Lukewarm Support from Industrial Class
•  Poor participant from peasents
•  Non-Cooperation vs Civil Disobedience — People were now asked not only to refuse cooperation 
with the British, as they had done in 1921-22, but a/so to break colonial laws. So, it was an 
ideological progression. This time objective was complete independence. There was poor Muslim 
participation this time and labor participation was also poor.
•  This movement, however, catapulted Gandhi on international arena and for the first time women 
also participated in large number in a national movement.
• GANDHI — IRWIN PACT or DELHI PACT (MARCH 1931)
•  Background — As British repression became harder during Civil Disobedience Movement, it led to 
sufferance of common people. In such a situation, Mahatma Gandhi once again decided to call off the 
movement and he along with many others was arrested only to be released in 1931. Congress didn't 
participate in {irst Round Table Con(erence which was though attended by Muslim League, Hindu 
Mahasabha, Chamber of Princes, the Liberals and Dalits and it was specu/ated thot 0^y Agreement 
without the participation o( Congress will be (utile. Irwin was also anxious to (ind a so/ution and 
in a gesture he released the political prisioners and decided to directly talk to Gandhi.
•  In this backdrop, Gandhi entered into a pact with Irwin on 5 March 1931. The Pact and direct 
Gandhi-Irwin talks put Congress on equal terms with government and this move o( Irwin was also 
criticized in Britain for shedding too much space.
•  Below were the proposed conditions —
•  I. Discontinuation o( the civil disobedience movement by the Indian National Congress
•  II. Participation bY the indian National Congress in the Round Table Con(erence
•  III. Withdrawal o( all ordinances issued by the British Government imposing curbs on the 
activities of the Indian National Congress


















   
   


 

•  IV. Release o( prisoners arrested for participating in the civil disobedience movement V. 
Removal o( the tax on sa/t, which allowed the Indians to produce, trade, and sell salt legally and 
for their own private use. Things that were not accepted by British as a part of Gandhi Irwin pact 
or Delhi Pact —
•  I. However, Congress demand for a police enquiry into arrests and atrocities made during Civil 
Disobedience movement was rejected.
•  II. Commutation o( sentences o( Bhagat Singh and his comrades
•  III. The pact also didn't accept demand o( immediClte return o( the lands confiscated during 
movement (this caused musch resentment among the radicals)

•  By this Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Gandhiji consented to participate in a Round Table Conference in 
London and the government agreed to release the political prisoners. The pact was criticized by 
radicals for not extracting definite gains from government and compromising on the demand of Swaraj 
by agreeing to participate in Round Table Conference. Candhij was perhaps aware thot mass movements 
are essentia!!Y ‹hort lived and he tried to leverage the situation by extrcicting some gans from 
British government.
• KARACHI SESSION (MARCH 1931)
•  Background — The Gandhi-Irwin pact was criticised by radical nationalists, for Gandhiji was 
unable to obtain from the Viceroy a commitment to political independence for Indians; he could 
obtain merely an assurance of talks towards that possible end. It was organised even as many 
Congress leaders opposed the Gandhi-Irwin pact, for the government had not accepted even one ot the 
major nation6ilist demands (viz — demand for police enquiry, return of confiscated peasant lands). 
It had not agreed even to the demand that the death sentence on Bhagat Singh and his two comrades 
be commuted to life imprisonment. It was termed as a bourgeoise agreement, which ignored masses. 
However, the session aimed at approving Gandhi Irwin Pact.
•  Gandhiji prevailed upon the session to approve the agreement. He was greeted with black (lag and 
(lowers bY angry protestors. Further, Candhiji and Congress as national representatives in that 
congress was disputed BY three sections - Muslim League, Princly states and BR Ambedkar (he accused 
congress of ignoring the welfare of lower castes).
•  However, the session is significant from following point of views -
•  I. It endorsed Delhi Pact or Gandhi Irwin Pact
•  II. For the first time it moved a resolution on Fundamental Rights and the draft resolution was 
prepared bY Jawahar Lal Nehru (session was presided over by Vallabhai Patel)
•  III. It for the first time explained the concept of Purna Swaraj and reiterated it as goal
•  IV. It also declared that interests o( miDOTitY ill be looked after and their culture will be 
preserved
•  V. It acknowledged the brave sacrifice o( Bhagat Singh and others

•  Significance of the Karacahi Resolution lies in the fact that — it remained the basic essence of 
political and economic programmes of Congress in later years.








   
   


 

•  Karachi Congress Resolution, 1931 - Swaraj as conceived by the Congress should include real 
economic freedom of the masses. The Congress declares that no constitution will be acceptable to it

• 2nd ROUND SECOND TABLE CONFERENCE (DEC 1931)
•  Background - The Congress had boycotted the first Round Table Conference (1930) which was 
actively attended by princely states, Ambedkar and other non-Congress parties. Ambedkar also raised 
the issue of separate electorate for Dalits and Jinnah demanded more safeguards for the Muslims 
(these two







   
   


 

•  demands were reflected in Communal Award of 1932). After Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Gandhi was sent as a 
representative of Congress.
•  Objective of Round table Conference — Round table conference were in line with the 
constitutional progtression envisaged by the British which were outlined by the Simon Commission as 
well to chart out a future course of action for political mechanism in India. One of the prime 
objective of Congress to participate in it was demand of Indians for more autonomy and dominion 
status.
•  Though the round table conferences were termed as 1›‹, 2 d, and 3 d. It will be wrong to term as 
so because — it was basically a single conference that was held in three sessions.
•  In April, before Second Round Table Conference, Irwin was replaced by new Viceroy Willingdon and 
he was not ready to take a liberal attitude as taken by Irwin. Even before Gandhi left for 
Conference there were complaints regarding the non-release of prisioners in some areas, repression 
of Khudai Khidamtgars in NWFP and Gandhi was refused permission to go there.
•  Non-Congress parties were involved by the British in a big way at the 2 d Round Table Conference 
as well. In December 1931, Gandhiji went to London for the conference, but the negotiations broke 
downon the minority issue. Not only Muslims demanded separate electorate, this time minorities led 
by Ambedkar also demanded separate electorate. British also refused to grant Dominion Status a key 
demand of Congress. Gandhi pressed upon point of Constitutional reforms and leaving behind communal 
arguments. But no consensus was reached and he returned disappointed. It failed because of initial 
non-attendance by the Congress and because Gandhi, who later did attend, claimed he was the only 
representative of all of India.
• Outcomes —
• I. Two new Muslim majority provinces — NWFP and Sindh to be created
•  II. Setting up of Indian Consultative Committee
• III. Prospect of a uni/atera/ Communal Award if Indians failed to agree.
•  IV. New right/conservative government under Churchil refused to put Congress on equal footing 
and adopted a stern attitude, in its aftermath new Viceroy refused to have a meeting with Gandhiji

•  Back in India, Gandhi discovered that the government had begun a new cYcle o( repression. Gaffar 
Khan and Jawaharlal Nehru were both in jail, the Congress had been declared illegal, and a series 
of measures had been imposed to prevent meetings, demonstrations and boycotts. Press was gagged and 
Congress was still facing ban. New Viceroy Willington and Secretary of State had adopted a tough 
stance against Gandhi and they decided not to negotiate any further like the former Viceroy Irwin 
didearlier.
•  With great apprehension, Mahatma Gandhi relaunched the Civil Disobedience Movement. For over a 
year, the movement continued, but by 1934 it lost its momentum due to severe repression by 
government.
• Causes of Failure of 2 d Phase of Civil Disobedience Movement —
•  Major Leaders were Behind Bars
•  Poor Support from Peasentry
•  Inertia and apparent disappointment from Gandhian politics

•  To break the lull in activities, council entrY as suggested on the line of Swarajists by 
Satayamurti which was later endorsed by likes of Bhulabhai Desai, M A Ansari. As a result Congress 
participated in Central Legislative Elections of 1934 and it won a heavy majority.

   
   


 

•  Within Congress as well, an alternative ideological development happened and Congress Socialist 
Party was born as a left leaning faction.
•  In the meanwhile, many nationalists thought that the struggle against the British could not be 
won through non-violence. In 1928, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army (HSRA) was founded at a 
meeting in Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi as an offshoot of Hindustan Republican Association 
visibly influenced by socialist ideas. Amongst its leaders were Bhagat Singh, Jatin Das and Ajoy 
Ghosh. In a series of dramatic actions in different parts of India, the HSRA targeted some of the 
symbols of British power. In April 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeswar Dutta threw a bomb in the 
Legislative AssemblY In the same year there was an attempt to blow up the train that Lord Irwin was 
travelling in.
•  New Viceroy Willigdon who replaced Irwin believed that government did a major mistake by 
reaching a truce with Congress and by putting Gandhi on equal par. He was determined this time to 
crush Congress.
• COMMUNAL AWARD (1932) and POONA PACT (1933)
•  Background — In the wake of inconclusive Round Table Talks, British government had declared 
that, if a consensus was not reached on separate representation of minorities, a unilateral 
communal award will be made. Government kept its promise in form of Communal Award of 1932.
•  The Communal Award was by the British Prime Minister Ramsay McDonald on 4 August 1932 to grant 
separate electorates to minority communities in India, including Muslims, Sikhs, and Dalit (then 
known as the Depressed Classes or Untouchables) in India (during Round Table Discussions, separate 
electorate was demanded by not only Muslim Leaders but by Ambedkar and other minorities as well). 
The depressed classes were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from special 
constituencies in which voters belonging to the depressed classes only could vote.
• The award was opposed for provision of separate electorate by Congress and other nationalist 
leaders and was viewd as a port o( ‘Divide and Rule’ policy of Britain. The Award was highly 
controversial and opposed by Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi called the award as — ‘English Attack on 
Hindu-Mus/im Unity’. He argued that what Dalits need is eradication o( untouchabi/iU and 
discrimination and not {urther division. In the award he saw similar consequences o( Mus/im having 
separate e/ector6ite and ultimate/y demanding a separate notion. He began an indefinite hunger 
strike at Yerwada Central Jail from September 20, 1932 to protest this Award.

















   
   


 

•  Communal Award was supported by many among the minority communities, most notably the Dalit 
leader, Dr. B R Ambedkar. Madan Mohan Malviya acted as a mediater between Gandhi and Ambedkar and 
after lengthy negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Dr. Ambedkar to have a single Hindu 
electorate, with Dalits having seats reserved within it (in fact, seats for Dalits were increased 
after the Pact). This is called the Poona Pact. Electorates {or other religions like Muslim and 
Sikh remained separate.
•  After this pact, Gandhi put renewed effort towards upIi{tment o( Dalits. He started a magazine 
called — Harijan and he also spent one year in comm••”Y service of Dalits and spreading the message 
of untouchability. However, orthodox Hindus sternly opposed his efforts.
•  Soon after that in 1934, Gandhi renounced the membership of Congress and expressed his desire to 
put Jawahar in as next leader. As a result, Jawahar was elected president in 1935 and 1936.
• GOVERNMENT of INDIA ACT (1935)
•  Background — Third Round Table Conference happened in 1932, and no Congress leader participated. 
However its discussion and discussions of earlier Round Tables and Simon Commission recommendations 
led to the enactment of 1935 Act.
• The Act provided for an all India federal structure as a union of Princly States and Provinces. 
Inclusion of  inc/y States was an idea to oct as a balance against the rising notions/ism in the 
provinces.
• Features of the Act -
•  I. It introduced Federalism in India with Princly States and Provinces being its parts and 
introduced Federal List, Provincial List and Concurrent List. However, this never became a remits 
fOt Princly St£ltes didn't approve this.
•  II. Provincial Autonomy replaced Provincial Diarchy (after unpopular nature of Dyarchy in 
Provinces, Simon Commission suggested its abolition) i.e. Responcible ‹Government was introduced in 
Provinces. Governor has to now act on the advice o( the miniters responsible to Provincial 
Legislature.
•  III. Bicameralism was introduced in 6 out of 11 Provinces.
•  IV. There was also to be a bicameral federal legislature in which the (princly) states were 
given disproportionate weight age. Moreover, the representatives of the states were not to be 
elected *Y he people, but appointed directlY bY the rulers.
• V. NWFP was given status of province and Burma was separated from India (Burma became
part of India only during British)
•  VI. Diarchy at federal/central level was introduced and abolished at provincial level
•  VII. Emergency power was vested in Governor General and Governors in Provinces — The 
Governor-General and the Governors were to be appointed by the British government. Though power was











   
   


 


•  given to provinces, the Governors were given special powers. They could veto legislative action. 
Moreover, they retained full control over the civil service and the police.Governer General was 
given ‘Emergency Powers’.
•  VIII. Separate Electorate was provided for Hindu and Muslims as was provided by 1909 and 1919 
Acts too.
•  IX. Limited Franchise — Only 14 per cent (1/6) of the total population in British India was 
given the right to vote. Even this legislature, in which the princes were once again to be used to 
check and counter the nationalist elements, was denied any real Power.
•  X. Key Portfolios were kept under British Control — Defense and foreign affairs remained outside 
its control, while the Governor-General retained special control over the other subjects.
•  XI. Lower house termed as — Legislative Assembly and Upper House as Council of States
•  XII. Vote on Budget was also allowed
•  XIII. ‘Vote o( No Con(idence’ and ‘Idea o( Collective Representation’ was introduced.
•  XIV. There were also other features of the act like — Establishment of a Fedearl Court, A 
Federal Bank (RBI), Federal Public Service Commission etc.

•  Foreign rule was to continue as before; only a (ew popuI• !Y elected ministers were to be added 
to the structure and the Congress condemned the Act as ‘totally disappointing’. The act was 
condemned by one and all. Jawaharlal Nehru termed this Act as — ‘The Act is a car without engines, 
but all brakes’.
• It didn't mention the Dominion Statusas was promised by Simon Commission.
•  It also carried on provision o(separate e/ectorote which wou/d also lead to {urther communal 
divide. Separate electorate was long opposed by Congress.
•  On the basis of the Act, the first ‘provincial elections’ were held in February 1937 and they 
conclusively demonstrated that a large majority of Indian people supported the Congress and it 
recorded majority in 8 out of 11 provinces. Congress ministries were formed in July 1937 in seven 
out of eleven provinces. However they had to work under supervision of governor.
•  Despite the criticism of the Act at that time, many of the provisions of the Act were adopted by 
the government of India after Independence and this act was landmark in terms of concessions 
provided to Indians and the changes that it proposed in the governing system. This is the reason 
that it is termed as ‘Point o( no return to (reedom’.
• Congress for the first time officially demanded establishment of a Contitutional Aseembly
in its 1935 session based on adult franchise to draft Constitution.






1937 ELECTIONS
Jawahar Lal Nehru, Bose, Congress Socialists and Communists were against the idea of entering into 
Provincial elections which were scheduled to be held in 1937 for the first time according to the 
1935 Act. According to them it defeats their purpose because —
Paticipating would dilute their stand and will be akin to cooperating with the repressive 
government
   
   


 

Assuming o((ices a(ter elections means having ‘responsibility without power’ as the governing 
structure has not changed much
Assuming the office would take away the revolutionary character that movement has assumed since 
1919

Others argued that while focus of congress is still on the activities outside the legislature, 
entering the legislatures is onIY• short term tactic to bust the Act o( 1935 (rom within and to 
practiCO!!Y demonstrate the hollowness of the Act. It was also termed as a part of all round 
strategy with ultimate goal as independence. With this assurance, Jawahar started his campaign 
extensively in
1936 and in his election manifesto made three things clear —
• Goal of Congress is still attainment of Independence
• Congress still rejects 1935 Act
•  Formation ot Constituent Assembly is sti/I top prioFlty 0( Congress (INC in 1936 for the time 
proposed to constitute the Constitution Assembly to form the Indian Constitution)

Congress won in majority of provinces with exception of Bengal, Sind, Punjab, Assam, NWFP etc and 
it formed ministries in many of them. To match their acts with their electoral promises, leaders 
took the steps like — reduced their salaries, traye/led through trains in second and third class. 
It initiated many reforms, passed many legislations, freed political prisioners.
The elations also had another undesirable outcome. /t widened the Aft between Congress and the 
League and it became more communal and more strident in its demand of a separate nation. The 
Congress's failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its 
social support. The Congress's rejection of the League's desire to form a joint Congress League 
government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League.
However, its performance was limited by various factors, especially in the field of agrarian 
reforms —
l. Inherent power still lied with center and Vicer Ys and Governors had the power to veto their
resolutions
II. Congress had little (inancial resources as lion's share was taken by the Center
III. According to mechanism of bicameralism in provinces, most of the provinces, there were 
‘legislative councils’ also which had elections on the basis of limited {ronchise and were occupied 
bY the landlords, zamindars and other elites. A lower house support was often not enough to
pass a legislation and this led to compromise on many issues including agrarian reforms which ran 
counter to the interests of these members.
   
   


 

IV. Vested interests withing Congress also scuttled its plans of reforms and infightings and 
bickering further aggravated it

Muslim League and 1937 election — The election came as a great disappointment for Muslim League. 
Jinnah was called (rom London to lead Muslim League in 2935, but despite that it secured only 
around 100 seats out of the allotted 480 seats. This failure left it with no choice but to resort 
to communalism and it got manifested in the 1937 by elections in UP when it rallied the voters on 
the name o{A/lab and Kuran. Nehru strongly condemned this Act. This was turning point in the 
history of communalism in India when it took an extreme form which was aggravated in coming years.
TIRUPURI SESSION and FORWARD BLOCK (1939)
Gandhi had retired from Congress in 1934 and Congress under Jawahar's leadership has acquired a 
taste of socialism and radicalism. Subhas was chosen unanimously in February 1938 session of 
Congress at Haripura to built upon that trend. In that session under the leadership of Bose, 
Congress passed a resolution to opposition to the impending imperio/istic war.
Difference between Gandhi and Subhash — However, Gandhi had a sY pathetic corner (or British in
this hour o( dif(iCuItY and he also didn't like the idea of Subhash to join the other European 
(orces in a bid to bring (reedom to India. Other issue was Subhash’s plan for industrialised 
development, which Gandhi opposed in favor of grass root level changes. These differences came in 
open in the next session of Congress of 1939 in Tirupuri when Gandhi fielded Patabhai Sitaramaiya 
as candidate and he was defeated and Bose re-elected.
Bose declared its opposition to fascism and imperialism alike and passed a resolution in this 
effect along with a resolution demanding independence and {orming a constituent assemblY He also 
open!Y Criticized moderate policies of Congress and called for an aggressive movement. This open 
criticism irked many veterans and 12 o{ the working Committee members (out of 15) resigned and in 
the same year Govind Vallabh Pant moved a resolution to form a new working committee under Gandhian 
leadership. The resolution was passed and Bose stepped down from presidency.
Congress Socialist Party refrained from voting and Bose called it as a betrayal. He formed Forwards 
Block in 1939, first as a part of Congress then parted ways with it.




SECOND WORLD WAR and INDIA



   
   


 

In 1939 World war broke out and British declared participation of India in War without permission 
from or consultation with Indians. League (on conditional support thot constitutional decisions 
will be taken with its consent) and Princly States supported the War.
Gandhi expressed sympathy, while Subhash urged for taking benefit of this situation to launch a 
full blown movement. Nehru was in middle and argued for refraining from the war and at the same 
time not taking advantage. ‘Tell me the di((erence between Imperialism and Fascism’, remarked 
Nehru.
British o((ered Dominion Status to India outer War, but Congress {ound it too little too late. All 
Congress ministers resigned (rom provinces in 1939 in protest o( alleged involvement o( India in 
war without consultation with Indians. League celebrated 22 December 1939 as ‘Deliverence Day’ from 
Congress rule.
Congress agreed to provide conditional support and put forward two demands — After the war 
constituent assembly should be convened
Immediately some form of responsible government should be established at the center


Viceroy Linglithgo rejected these demands. Government tried to use Chamber o(Princes and Muslim 
League against Congress. It further wanted to regain lost ground on pretext of war.
A nationalist movement was not initiated by Congress during the war because —
Gandhi and other leaders thought that cause o{Allied Forces was just and it will be unfair to go 
for a national movment at this difficult hour
Secondly, communal passions were at an all times high and this threatened any new national movement 
also and a movement may degenerate into a communal riot
Most importantly, leaders thought that people were not readY I r the mass movement at this stage

Gandhi wrote — ‘We don't seek our Independence out o{ British ruin’. This view was summed up in the 
Ramgarh Session of the Congress when the working committee passed a resolution to this effect.
However, as the condition of Allied Forces aggravated and a danger loomed even on India, Congress 
agreed (or a conditional support i( the British free India after the war.
To negotiate the demands of Indians of Complete dependence Viceroy made an offer known as — ‘August 
Offer’ — which didn't talk o( independence and was rejected by both League and Congress. In the 
meanwhile in 1940, Muslim league demanded a ‘separate constituency’ (still a demand for separate 
nation was not there) for Muslims in its Lahore Resolution.
Gandhi launched an Individual Satyagraha in the meanwhile.

   
   


 

Amidst this, British PM sent Staf(ord Cripps to forge a compromise with Gandhi and Congress and 
seek their support for war. Talks broke down, however, after the Congress insisted that if it was 
to help the British defend India from the Axis powers, then the Viceroy had first to appoint an 
Indian as the Defence Member of his Executive Council.
TWO NATIONS THEORY and LAHORE RESOLUTION (1940)
Amidst all the confusion over war and Congress’ dielemma of joining the war, Muslim League passed a 
resolution in its 1940 session declaring that ‘Muslims are not a minority, but a separate nation’.
This gave rise to 'Two notion Theo Y' It called for the creation of 'independent states' for 
Muslims in British India. The constituent units of these states were to be autonomous and sovereign 
[The name ’Pakistan'had been suggested in 1933 by a Cambridge scholar Rehmat Ali, but was not 
(ormally announced in this resolution].
AUGUST OFFER (1940)
The August offer 1940 was made on August 8, 1940 by Viceroy Lord Linglithgow, the eve of the Battle 
of Britain in which it was beleagured to seek support of India by providing some concessions on 
front of self-rule that were earlier demanded by Indians.
The offer in principle accepted the demand (or Constituent AssemblY
The Viceroy at the time, Lord Linlithgow, made a fresh offer that promised —
I. Dominion Staus
II. The expansion o( the governor-general's Executive Council to include more Indians
III. The Establishment of an Advisory War counci/
IV. Giving full weight to minority opinion
V. Recognition of Indians' right to frame their own constitution (after the war would end), framed
’main/y’ by Indians.


In return, it was hoped that all parties and communities in India would cooperate in Britain's war 
efforts.
However, the Congress as well as League rejected this offer, and Gandhi viewed it as having 
'widened the gul( between Nationalist India and the British ru/er’ and he launched Individual 
Satyagraha’ as result. Nehru reacted that — 'Dominion Status is dead as door nail'.
However, this offer for the first time recognized right of Indians to frame their own constitution.
Further, for the first time Dominion Status was expIicit!Y offered.
INDIVIDUAL SATYAGRAHA (1940)



   
   


 

Background — In 1940, after refusal of August Offer, Congress was in a fix again. While some wanted 
to organize a mass Civil Disobedience movementas they saw it as a right opportunity as Britain was 
entangled in war, others — mainly Gandhi — wanted to go for Individual Satyagraha as he didn't want 
to take advantage of difficult situation of the British.
Its aim was to show that nationalist patience was not a sYmbol o( weakness and people made no 
difference between colonialism and Nazism. Further, it was a warning to government as well as 
giving it another opportunitiy.
There were three people who were nominated by Gandhi himself as Individual satyagrahi. First was 
Acharya Vinoba Bhave. He was arrested soon after he started it. Other two were Jawaharlal Nehru and 
Brahama Dutt. They too were arrested. Individual Satyagraha was very limited and was withdrawn by 
end of 1940. However it was relaunched in 1941 and this times it had some mass appeal and thousands 
were arrested.
CRIPPS MISSION (1942)
Background - In 1939 the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, declared India a party to war without consulting 
Indian political leaders or the elected provincial representatives. This caused considerable 
resentment in India and provoked the resignation en masse of elected Congress PartY Provincial 
Governments in 1939 (which were elected in 1937), giving rise to the prospect o( public revolt and 
political disorder in India. Government tried to reconcile with August Offer, but that was rejected 
and instead Individual Satyagraha was launched. News that ’Atlantic Charter’ won't be applicable to 
Indians (which was signed between US and Britain and provided the (reedom to people to chose their 
own government) further angered Indian leaders.
It was another attempt in late March 1942 by the British government to secure Indian cooperation 
and support for their efforts in World War II. The offer was made in a situation in which, Britain 
was pushed against the wall in wake of rising facism aggression —
•  As Japan approached towards Asia, British felt a need to garner support of British Indian Army.
•  There was also pressure (rom Allied forces to seek Indian cooperation.


Pandit Nehru and Mulana Azad were official negotiators with the Cripps Mission. Cripps spent a 
major chunk of his time in bringing congress and league on the same table. But, there was little 
frusf between the British and Congress by this stage, and both sides felt that the other was 
concealing its true plans.
Major Features of Cripps Mission were (Almost same as August Offer) —

   
   


 

I. Dominion Status with later right to withdraw from Commonwealth
II. Reconstitution o( Viceroy’s Executive Council
III. Constitutional Making Body (or India - Consisting of elected members of provinces and 
representatives from princely states
IV. War Executive Council — A war executive council was proposed having Indian representation, 
however Defense of India will be retained by the government
V. Provinces may have separate Constitution


Unlike August offer, it gave offer o( Constitution making by Indians alone and not mainly’ by 
Indians as proposed in August Offer. Secondly, it was given right to withdraw from Commonwealth. 
Failure of Cripps Mission -
I. It spent most o{ the time in negotiations with Congress and League which remain adamant.
II. Viceroy and SecretarY ( State worked {rom behind to sabotage its egorts.
III. Gandhi's opposition led the Indian Nations/ Congress to reject the British offer,
IV. Cripps’ modification of the original British offer, which provided for no real transfer of 
power and offered only Dominion Status which was rejected by Indians
V. Another major reason was the Cripps incapacitY to bargain, he was told to not go beyond the 
boundaries of Draft Plan.
While the demand of Congress was of Independence, Gandhi said that Cripps's offer of Dominion 
status after the war was a ’Post dated cheque drawn on a crushing bank’.
Major objections of Congress were dominion status. It also objected to the basis of nomination of 
the princely states through nomination and not by people themselves. Right of provinces to secede 
also went against plan of united India. Muslim League criticized idea of  single union. Depressed 
felt that partition wi/I leave them at the mercy o( Hindu and Mus/im majority elite.
QUIT INDIA (1942) or AUGUST KRANTI
Background — Failure of August offer and Cripps Mission has left Indians with little choice and 
government has also shown repressive tendencies as witnessed in Individual Satyagraha.
Government was also adamant with its lame proposal of Dominion Status. There was a general price 
rise and hardship for common man in wake of war. News of reversals suffered by British in War and 
expectations of its imminent collapse as the Imperial Japanese Army advanced closer to India with 
the conquest of Burma, Indians perceived an inability upon the part of the British to defend Indian 
soil.


   
   


 

When the British remained unresponsive, Gandhi and the Congress began planning a major public 
revolt, the Quit India movement — the first truly pan Indian mass movement. This period concurred 
with the rise of the Indian National Army, led bY Subhash Chandra Bose. The British response to the 
Quit India movement was to throw most of the Congress leadership in jail. Jinnah took a separate 
line and instead supported British and League even participated in proyincio/ elections.
In the 8th August Bombay session, Congress passed the Quit India resolution at Gowalia Tank and its 
draft was prepared bY*^wahar Lal Nehru and seconded by Patel. Gandhi called for a ’Do or Die’ and 
gave slogans of ’Quit /ndia’ and ’Bharat Choro’. Very next day of Gowalia Tank meet, major leaders 
were arrested under ’Operation Thunderbolt’ launched by the British.
Common people showed unprecedented heroism, but they also faced unprecedented repression. On the 
name of war, government had armed itself with draconian provisions and laws.
There were other events like — Forcing people in Bengal and Orissa to restrict the use o( their 
boats in (ear o(Japanese capture and use against British, news from South East were that British 
only evacuated white natives when Japanese Clttocked and thus leaving locals on thei fate.
This lead to anger and confusion and people came on roads, hartaals ensued and clashes happened. 
Underground activities started and even porol/el governments were (ormed like the one in Satara. A 
new underground leadership emerged led by Achyut Patwardhan, R M Lohia, Sucheta Kriplani, 
Chhotubhai Puranik, R P Goenka and J P Narayan.
A new event happened in 1943, when Gandhi announced a 10 d«/ fast in Jai/ in response to British 
government's exhortation to condemn the yio/ence committed by people. \ nstead of condemning the 
violence, Gandhi fasted on. It raised public anger many a fold. He issued specific instructions to 
various groups —
I. Government Servants — Don't resign, but declare Y • allegiance to the Congress.
II. Soldiers — Don't leave the army, but dOLl’t ire on yOUrcompatriots
II l. Students — I( con(ident leave the studies
IV. Peasants — If Zamindars are pro-government, don't pay the rent. If they are anti government, 
pay.
V. Princes — Support the masses and accept the sovereignty of people.


Time movement was short lived, but signtftcant as it marked a new high in mass participation and 
made it amply clear to British that it will no longer be possible to suppress the masses. Students 
and the peasantry served as the backbone, middle class and bureaucracy sided government.
Sardar Vallabhai Patel was the most fervent supporter of Gandhi's proposal for an all-out campaign 
of civil disobedience during Quit India Movement. He participated in Gandhi's call for individual

   
   


 

disobedience, and was arrested in 1940 and imprisoned for nine months. He also opposed the 
proposals of the Cripps’ mission in 1942.
Muslim league after the Quit India came with its own ’Divide and Quit’ demand. Features of Quit 
India Movement -
I. It was a spontaneous movement
II. It was not non-violent like earlier movements of Gandhi, it was first violent movement and the 
last one too launched by Gandhi. There were many incidences of violence
III. It didn't attract labor class in general
IV. Gandhi didn't call for the government servants to leave their jobs but declare their support to 
Congress. Similarly he asked army not to leave, but not fire on compatriots.

Phases of Quit India Movement —
I. Urban Phase — Lasted for only one week
II. Rural Phase — Sabotage of government communication lines and transportation. It lasted for a 
few months around 3-4 months
III. Under ground movement — it was the most violent and long lasting. All India Congress Radio was 
operated by Usha Mehta. Asif Ali and Aruna Asif Ali trained everyone to operate multiple centers.
IV. Parallel Governments — Various parallel governments were formed —
a. Balia, UP — Under Chittu Pandey
b. Tumluk, Bengal — Tamralipta National Government of Tumluk was different as it set up separate 
police, and revenue system. It also carried out relief work, supplied paddy from rich to poor. They 
also had an active Women's Wing ’Bidyut Vahim’. Its major leaders were — Ajoy Kumar Mukharjee, 
Matangini Hazara, Satish Chandra Samanta, Sushil Kumar Dhara.
c. Satara, Maharashtra — Under Achyut Patwardhan, YB Chavan, Nana Patil etc. Village libraries were 
formed and Nyayadan Mandals were organized, prohibition campaigns were organized.
Quit India repression was one of the most violent repressions since repression of 1857. Around 
10,000 people lost their lives.
It made in a way final assertion of the will of people who were determined now not be held back by 
any false promises.
C R FORMULA or RAJAJI FORMULA and GANDHI-JINNAH TALKS (1944)
Background — Muslim League was intransigent on any issue of conciliation with Congress. Gandhi 
wanted a united India and sought to break this deadlock and on C Rajaji's inducement he got ready 
for talks. C Rajagopalachari proposed a formula (or C R formula or Rajaji formula) to solve the
   
   


 

political deadlock between the All India Muslim League and Indian National Congress on independence 
of India from the British. It was presented via a pamphlet 'The WaY Out'.
It offered the League the after independence, Pakistan based on plebiscite of ml/the peoples in the
regions where Mus/ims made a majority and in turn Muslim League should support the demand for 
Independence. This in some way g6ive approval (or separate Pakistan to which as per C Rajaji, 
Gandhi also agreed as formula had provision that after Independence if plebiscite called for a 
separate sovereign Pakistan, so it be.
Although the (ormula was opposed even within the Congress partY. Gandhi used it as his proposal in 
his talks with Jinnah in 1944. However, Jinnah rejected the proposal and the talks failed. Jinnah 
refused to accept the Rajaji Formula as Itdid not meet the League's full demand for Pakistan. The 
provision of plebiscite in the (ormula didn't go down well with the Muslim leaders. They agreed for 
plebiscite only in some areas and not in ol/ places.
In talks with Gandhi also, Candhi loathed the idea ofto separate nations which lead to their 
failure. Gandhi was adamant that any tats of p«tition should be held after British leave Inrfio 
which was not acceptable to Jinnah.
Hence, Jinnah rejected the initiative, telling his Council that it was intended to 'torpedo' the 
'Lahore resolution’; it was 'grossest travesty', a 'ridiculous proposal' and he termed it as — 'a 
shadow and a husk, maimed, mutilated Pakistan'.
DESAI-LIAQAT PACT
To end the deadlock another attempt was made. Bhullabhi Desai and Liaqat Ali Khan came up with a
dra(t of forming an 'interim government' at the center, consisting of —
l. Equal number o( representatives nominated bY League and Congress
II. 20% seats reserved for minorities





SHIMLA CONFERENCE and WAVELL PLAN (1945)
As the Gandhi-Jinnah talks over Rajaji formula failed, government offered another way to reconcile 
the differences between the two. The Shimla Conference was a 1945 meeting between Viceroy Wavell 
and the major political leaders of /ndio at Simla, India to discuss composition of Viceroy's 
Executive Council. Convened to agree on and approve the Wavell Plan for Indian self-government, it 
reached a potential agreement for the set(-rule of Udio thot provided separate representation to 
Muslims and reduced majority powers for both communities in their majority regions.

   
   


 

However, talks stalled on the issue o(selection ofbus/imrepresentatives.The conference broke down 
on the insistence of Jinnah that his party should have an exc/usiye right to nominate Muslim 
members o( the \7iceroy’s Executive Council. This was something which the Congress could not 
concede without repudiating its national composition and saw this as an attempt to brand itself a 
caste Hindu party.
This scuttled the conference, and perhaps the last viable opportunity for a united, independent 
India. When the Indian National Congress and All India Muslim League reconvened under the Cabinet 
Mission the next year, the Indian National Congress was far less sympathetic to the Muslim League's 
requests despite Jinnah's approval of the British plan.
In the meanwhile, Government changed in Britain and hostile Churchil was replaced by Clement Attlee 
of Labor Party. Pethwick Lawrence became new secretary of state.
Further, elections were held in 1945-46 in India too and both Muslim League and Congress won 
heavily in their respective constituencies. This {urther bolstered the con(idence o( Muslim League. 
INA and AZAD HIND FAUJ and INA TRIALS
INA was first formed by Mohan Singh and was later reorganized by Rash Behari Bose. Mohan Singh, 
Niranjan Shah Gill and Mohammed Akram were the Indian expats who for the first time originally 
formed INA with the help of Japan. However, later due to disagreement with Japanese, INA was 
disbanded and they were again made PoW.
Rash Bihari Bose also contributed significantly to unite various local Indian Independence Leagues 
in East Asian countries to form All India Independence League. Command of INA was given to Subhash 
when he arrived in 1943.
Subhash formed a provisional government in Singapore and formed INA headquarters in Rangoon and 
Singapore and he famously gave the call of 'Delhi Chalo'. Netaji hoisted Indian flag in Andaman in 
December 1943 and renamed the islands as — 'Shahid' and 'SwClrClj' in memory of martyrs.
In 1944, INA started to advance along the eastern border and Kohima was taken. In the Imphal 
Campaign one Indian battalion led by Shah Nawaz was also allowed to go along Japanese. However, the 
(ailure of ! phal Campign and unequal treatment bY Japanese demoralized INA soldiers. With the 
Japanese surrender in 1945, Azad Hind Fauj's dream to liberate India was also shattered.
After surrender, famous INA trials at Red Fort took place in 1945-46. This saw massive rally of 
people and un-precedented emotional support for the brave patriots. Though the court martial held 
found the officers guilty, government under pressure released them. Trials garnered huge support 
cutting across the community lines as one of the main leaders was Hindu, Prem Sehgal, one was 
Muslim, Shah Nawaz Hussain and one a Sikh, Gurbaksh Singh DhiIIon.During war time, Indian Armies 
were

   
   


 

also employed to restore French and Dutch colonies and this also fuelled anti-imperialist 
sentiments as Britain on one hand was talking independence on the other hand was promoting 
colonialism.
In Calcutta, an INA officer Rashid Ali was sentenced for 7 years and this caused much anger.
In June 1944, with the end of the war in sight, Gandhiji was released from prison. Later that year 
he held a series of meetings with Jinnah, seeking to bridge the gap between the Congress and the 
League.
The prevailing conditions made it amply clear to the British that holding India away from 
Independence will no londer be feasible in a post war arena because —
•  It has grown weak
• Peer pressure from US and Russia
• Signals from INA for other possible armed struggles
•  Final straw came by RIN mutiny, which proved that army which used to be the stronghold of Britsh 
cannot remain insulated to national events, further strike by Signals Corps at Jabalpur also 
indicated similar things. These events broke the notion of loyal-Indians and they realized that 
Indians can no longer be relied for administrative work

In 1945, a Labour government came to power in Britain under prime minister Clement Attlee and 
committed itself to granting independence to India. Meanwhile, back in India, the Viceroy, Lord 
Wavell, brought the Congress and the League together for a series of talks. Elections took place 
with separate electorate and both Muslim league and congress participated and both recorded 
overwhelming majority in their respective reserved seats. And it made the political polarization 
complete, which culminated in the partition.
RIN RATING MUTINY (1946)
It started with an incident when a sailor on board o( INS Talwar wrote ’Quit India’ and he was 
arrested for this, however causes were deep rooted. Racil discrimination, unpalatable (ood, poor 
working conditions, abuse bYsenior o((icers, /NA trials were the causes.
The Royal Indian Navy mutiny (also called the Bombay Mutiny) encompasses a total strike and 
subsequent mutiny by Indian sailors of the Royal Indian Navy on board ship and shore establishments 
at Bombay (Mumbai) harbour on 18 February 1946. From the initial flashpoint in Bombay, the mutiny 
spread and found support throughout British India, from Karachi to Calcutta and ultimately came to 
involve 78 ships, 20 shore establishments and 20,000 sailors.
It was repressed by force by the British Royal Navy. ^!Y he Communist Party supported the 
strikers,-
the Congress and the Muslim League condemned it.

   
   


 

Two interpretations of movement —
I. Revolt for Freeedom — Nationalist historians on the far left have looked at the mutiny as a 
revolt against the British Raj and imperial rule.
II. Revolt against Bad Condition of Sailors - However naval historians argue that internal 
conditions in the Royal Indian Navy were more important sources of unrest.

Notably, the mutinying ships hoisted three (lags tied together — those of the Congress, Muslim 
League, and the Red Flag of the Communist Party of India (CPI), signifying the unity and 
demarginalisation of communal issues among the mutineers.
Rallies were organized in support of mutineers, food and essential items were sent on ships, 
hartals were organized.
The mutiny was called off following a meeting between the President of the Naval Central Strike 
Committee (NCSC) and Vallabh Bhai Patel of the Congress, who had been sent to Bombay to settle the 
crisis. Patel issued a statement calling on the strikers to end their action, which was later 
echoed by a statement issued in Calcutta by Mohammed Ali Jinnah on behalf of the Muslim League.
The mutiny was significant because till thot day there has been no revolt from the armed forces and 
this had a moral effect on masses and it electrified the whole nation. It prompted British 
government to treat /NA prisioners with lineoncy and only those who were accused of murder, and 
brutal crime were put to trio/. Soon Cabinet Mission also followed.
POST SECOND WORLD WAR
In post world war time, Indians have revealed their heroic tendencies during Quit India and INA. 
New struggle took place in the form of massive movement against onviction of INA soldiers. Under 
enormous pressure, government set them free.
Change in attitude of government in post war period was because of —
I. Power equation changed in post war period and both USA and Russia supported cause of 
independence of colonies including India.
II. War caused huge economic drain on Britain
III. There was a government change in Britain and Labor party won elections. Hostile Churchil was 
replaced by a more pragmatic Clemen Attlee who supported Indian cause.
IV. British soldiers were haggard after war and were not willing on further foreign jaunts.
V. British faith in Indian army and administrative machinery was also broken after RIN mutiny and 
Signals corps at Jabalpur.

   
   


 

VI. Congress as well as Muslim League performed well in provincial elections giving boost to 
support for domestic rule.

CABINET MISSION (1946)
After failure of Gandhi-Jinnha talks (1944) and Wavell plan (1945) Cabinet Mission was sent to 
India to —
I. Discuss the formation of interim government and outline of future government
II. Setting up of a constituent assembly.
Cabinet mission stood for united India. It was a last opportunity to ovoid portition. Its members 
were —Cripps, Pathwick Lawrence, Alexender
Attitude of British Government was now considerably changed due to following reasons —
•  War wearied awaY UK and it was no more a global superpower.
•  New Labor government was more sympathetic to Indian demands.
•  There was an anti-imperialist wave in South East Asia.
•  British soldiers were haggard and econOmY in a shambles.
•  RIN mutiny was a strong signal that Indians will no longer subjugate to imperial oppression


A Cabinet Mission sent in the summer of 1946 (ailed to get the Congress and the League to agree on 
a (ederal system that would keep India together while allowing the provinces a degree of autonomy. 
The Cabinet Mission toured the country for three months and recommended a loose three-tier 
confederation. \ ndia was to remain united. It was to have a weak centra/ government controlling 
only foreign affairs, defence and communications with the existing provincial assemblies being 
grouped into three groups. Initially all the major parties accepted this plan. It made following 
proposals initially —
I. A united Dominion of India would be given independence with opt-out clause.
II. Formation of a Constituent Assembly
III. There will be compulsory grouping with three groups.
•  Muslim-majority provinces would be grouped in two groups (Group B and C) — Baluchistan, Sind, 
Punjab and North-West Frontier Province would form one group, and Bengal and Assam would form 
another.
•  Hindu-majority provinces in central and southern India would form another group (Group A).
IV. The central government would be empowered to run foreign affairs, defence and communications, 
while the rest o( powers and responsibilitY WOLlId belong to the provinces,
   
   


 

coordinated by groups. (this provision lend a truly federal structure, which was not acceptable to 
center leaning congress)
V. Princly states will no longer be under Crown and they will be free to join the successor or 
continue their relations with Britain.

June 16 Plan — Congress rejected the concept of grouping - while League was vouching for compulsory 
grouping, Congress wanted a choice (or provinces to join anY grouping — as well as power to 
provinces and in this wake a revision was made which envisaged separate states (or Hindus and 
Muslims and a choice for provinces to take any o( the sides (Though British suggest that that 
initially only provinces will be grouped compulsorily, later on after formation of constitution, 
they will be free to get out of their grouping to other grouping. But Congress rejected it).
Congress later ruled out the June 16 plan also calling it divisive. However Muslim League agreed to 
it.
Elections of Constituent Assembly in 1946 resulted in huge Congress majority which Jinnah termed as 
‘Brute Majority’. This further stoked Muslim League's apprehensions of Congress dominance in 
partition and it led to demand for separate nation which was rejected by Congress. The rejection o( 
cabinet mission plan combined with recent Constituent Assembly results led to a resurgence o( 
con{rontationa/ politics beginning with the Muslim League's call for general strike known as’Direct 
action day’ and they called for — ‘Lekar rahenge Pakistan, Larkar lenge Pakisatan’.
This led to confrontation on the day and subsequent communal riots and Bihar killings. Only Mahatma 
Gandhi and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan of the NWFP continued to firmly oppose the idea of partition.
In a last bid, Wavell was replaced by Mounbetton for last round of talks, but that too failed. Out 
of senior Congress Leaders, it was Patel who was in favor of the Mountbetton Plan.
DIRECT ACTION DAY and NOAKHALI MASSACRE (1946)
Since 1940 when the Muslim League raised the Pakistan proposal at its Lahore convention, it had 
adopted an increasingly hostile attitude. Talks after talks failed including Cripps Mission talks, 
CR Formula (Gandhi Jinnah Talks), Desai-Liaquat Pact and finally Cabinet Mission. In the 1946, the 
Muslim League contested the elections on the plank of Pakistan, and an overwhelming 97% of the 
Muslim population of Bengal voted for Muslim League, but it also resulted in huge Congress majority 
which Jinnah termed as ‘Brute Majority’. This further stoked Muslim League's apprehensions o( 
Congress dominance in partition. The Muslim League re(used to accept the Cabinet Mission plan and


   
   


 

also re(used to join the Interim Government or Constituent Assembly. Congress on the other hand 
rejected the demand (or a separate state (or Muslims.
The rejection of cabinet mission plan combined with recent Constituent Assembly row led to a 
resurgence of confrontational politics beginning with the Muslim League's ‘Direct action day’ (16 
August 1946) as a general strike in Calcutta and they called for — ‘Lekar rahenge Pakistan, Larkar 
lenge Pakisatan’.
On that day meeting would be held all over the country to explain League's resolution. In Bengal, 
the only Muslim League ruled province in British India, the day was declared a public hoIid^Y 
However things turned ugly on the day of strike after initial skirmeshes between the two 
communities.
Kolkata witnessed an unprecedented mass violence in the next five days, leaving 4,000 dead. 
Violence in Calcutta sparked off further religious riots in the surrounding regions of Noakhali, 
Bihar, United Province (modern Uttar Pradesh), Punjab, and the North Western Frontier Province. 
These events sowed the seeds for the eventual Partition o( /ndio.
Noakhali genocide was a series of massacres, rapes, abductions and forced conversions of Hindus and 
loot and arson of Hindu properties, perpetrated by the Muslim community in the districts of Muslim 
dominated Noakhali and Tipperah in the Chittagong Division of Bengal in October— November 1946. 
Gandhi, camped in Noakhali for four months and toured the district in a mission to restore peace 
and communal harmony.
MOUNTBATTEN PLAN (1947) or 3rd JUNE PLAN
Background — The failure of the Cabinet Mission was followed by the collapse o( the interim 
Government. Furthermore, by the end of 1946 communal violence increased in the country and the 
British (eared thof /ndia wou/d seftle {or a civi/ war. In such a tumultuous situation, Lord 
Mountbatten replaced Lord Wavell as Viceroy of India in 1947.
Mountbatten's formula was to divide India and at the same time retain maximum possible unity. The 
actual division between the two new dominions of India and Pakistan was accomplished according to 
what has come to be known as the 3rd June Plan or Mountbatten Plan. It was announced at a press 
conference by Mountbatten on 4 June 1947, and the date of independence was also announced — 15 
August 1947. The main points of the plan were —
I. Partition — Muslim-dominated areas may be separated to form a Dominion. In that case such 
domination would be constituted by a partition of Bengal and the Punjab Hindus and Muslims in 
Punjab and Bengal legislative assemblies would meet and vote for partition. If a simple majority of 
either group wanted partition, then these provinces would be divided.


   
   


 

II. Referendum for NWFP and Sylhet - The fate of North West Frontier Province and Sylhet district 
of Bengal was to be decided by a referendum.
III. India would be free by 15th August 1947.
IV. Princly States — Independence o(princely states was ruled out. They would either join India or 
Pakistan. Independence for Bengal also ruled out.
V. A boundary commission to be set up in case of partition.


The Muslim league's demand o( a separate state was thus conceded. Congress’ position on unity was 
also taken into account while integrating the princely states to India.
Gandhi and Azad had been totally opposed to Mounbatten Plan as it confirmed the division of 
country.
INDIA INDEPENDENCE ACT (1947)
Indian Independence Act was passed in July 1947, which specified the following —
I. The British rule of India should be over on the midnight of August 15, 1947.
II. An independent dominion of India shall be created out of the United Provinces, Central 
Provinces, Bombay Presidency, Madras Presidency, the Carnatic, East Punjab, West Bengal, Assam and 
the Northeast Frontier Agency. The territories of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the 
Lakshadweep Islands are also turned over to the Indian Dominion.
III. An independent dominion of Pakistan shall be created out of the provinces of West Punjab, 
North West Frontier Province, Sindh and East Bengal.
IV. The all Princely states that were officially related to British Empire were made free from all 
the treaties and relationships and they could decide which dominion to join.
V. Both the Indian and Pakistan Dominions would be members of the British Commonwealth and was 
allowed to leave whenever they pleased.
VI. Both Dominions of India and Pakistan were completely self-governing in their internal affairs, 
foreign affairs and national security but the British monarch will continue to be their head of 
state, represented by the Governor-General of India and a new Governor-General of Pakistan.

PARTITION AND THE EVENTS LEADING TO IT
Right after the first rebellion of 1857, a section of Muslims Syed Ahmed Khan felt that Muslims are 
not getting due representation in India in every field.
I. Muslim League — Muslim League was founded in 1906.


   
   


 

II. Separate Electorate — It is argued that separate electorate of 1909 was one of the major acts 
that deepened the rift between Hindu and Muslims.
III. Lucknow Session of 1916 — It defacto gave consent to separate electorate.
IV. Non-Partition in Civil Disobedience — Participation of Muslims in Civil Disobedience, 1930, was 
negligible
V. Demand of Autonomous Region — Iqbal for the first time in 1930 put forward demand of an 
autonomous region for the Muslims
VI. Pakistan — Rehmat Ali a Cambridge scholar coined the term Pakistan in 1933 (Punjab, Afghaistan, 
Kashmir, Sindh, Baluchistan)
VII. Congress Attitude in 1937 Elections — In 1937 elections after gaining majority, Congress 
denied forming coalition with League
VIII. Lahore Session and ‘Two Nation Theory’ — 1940 — The Lahore Session of League passed a 
resolution with Theory of Two Nations.
IX. Divide and Quit — While Congress called for Quit India, League called for ‘Divide and Quit’ in 
1942
X. Direct Action Day, 1946 — Muslim League called a general strike in August 1946 and called it 
Direct Action Day. Foreign government instead of curbing the riots that ensued after call of Direct 
Action Day rather encouraged these by their divisive policies perhaps to play the two newly 
independent states against each other.
XI. Religious Angle — The efforts of the Arya Samaj to bring back to the Hindu fold (shuddhi) those 
who had recently converted to Islam irked Muslims. Hindus were angered by the rapid spread of 
tabligh (propaganda) and tanzim (organisation) after 1923.Other developments like Hindu groups like 
Hindu Mahasabha (1915), RSS, celeberation of Hindu festivals etc further reinforced the Hindu 
Identity.
XII. In the end, the secular and radical rhetoric of the Congress merely alarmed conservative 
Muslims and the Muslim landed elite, without winning over the Muslim masses.

Gandhi's Bid to Restore Peace — He moved to villages of East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) to the 
villages of Bihar and then to the riot-torn slums of Calcutta and Delhi, in a heroic effort to stop 
Hindus and Muslims kill each other, careful everywhere to reassure the minority community. In 
October 1946, Muslims in East Bengal targeted Hindus. Gandhiji visited the area, toured the 
villages on foot, and persuaded the local Muslims to guarantee the safety of Hindus. Similarly 
Gandhi persuaded Hindus to refrain from violence in other parts like Delhi. He held a fast in Delhi 
which


   
   


 

made many to change their hearts and minds. However, the streak of hatred could be ended only with 
the martyrdom of Gandhi.
POST INDEPENDENCE
Approximately one third of the total area was under princely states when India got independent. A 
big challenge was to integrate them into Indian union. With efforts of Vallabhai Patel most of them 
became part of India. Only three — Junagarh, Hyderabad and Kashmir didn't join. They were later 
integrated by various methods.








































   
   


 

INDIAN CULTURE

1. Religions

Religion has been an important part of India's culture throughout its history. Religious diversity 
and religious

tolerance are both established in the country by law and custom. A vast majority of Indians (over 
93%) associate

themselves with a religion. Four of the world's major religious traditions; Hinduism, Buddhism, 
Jainism and Sikhism

are originated at India. These religions are also called as ‘Eastern Religions’.

1. Hinduism

The word Hindu is derived from the Sanskrit name Sindhu for the Indus River. With around 1 billion 
followers,

Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world after Christianity and Islam. Hinduism is 
considered as the oldest

religion of the World originating around 5000 years ago. It is the predominant spiritual following 
of the Indian

subcontinent, and one of its indigenous faiths. Hinduism is a conglomeration of distinct 
intellectual or philosophical

points of view, rather than a rigid common set of beliefs. Hinduism was spread through parts of 
South- eastern Asia,

China, Korea, and Japan. Hindus worship a god with different forms.

Evolution

The origin of Hinduism dates back to prehistoric times. Some of the important evidences of 
prehistoric times:

• Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals gives evidence attesting to prehistoric 
religion in

the Indian "subcontinent".

• Neolithic pastoralists inhabiting the Indus River Valley buried their dead in a manner suggestive 
of spiritual practices that incorporated notions of an afterlife and belief in magic.
• Other Stone Age sites, such as the Bhimbetka rock shelters in central Madhya Pradesh and the 
Kupgal

petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka, contain rock art portraying religious rites and evidence of 
possible ritualised music.

   
   


 

• The people of the Indus Valley Civilization, centered around the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra river 
valleys,

may have worshiped an important mother goddess symbolising fertility.

• Excavations of Indus Valley Civilization sites show seals with animals and "fire -altars", 
indicating rituals
associated with fire. A linga-yoni of a type similar to that which is now worshiped by Hindus has 
also

been found.

• The oldest surviving text of Hinduism is the Rigveda, produced during the Vedic period (1700—1100

BCE). The Vedas center on worship of deities such as Indra, Varuna and Agni, and on the Soma 
ritual.

Fire-sacrifices, called yajña are performed by chanting Vedic mantras chanted but no temples or 
idols

are known.

• The earliest versions of the epic poems Ramayana and Mahabharata were written roughly from 
500—100

BCE.

• After 200 BC, several schools of thought were formally codified in Indian philosophy, including 
Samkhya,

Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Purva-Mimamsa and Vedanta.

• The 9th and 8th centuries BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads. Upanishads 
form

the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Veda). In 
Hinduism, Brahman is the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the 
phenomenal universe. Brahman is conceived as personal (”with qualities”), impersonal ("without 
qualities”) and/or supreme depending on the philosophical school.
Brahman should not be confused with Brahmin

Hindu Denominations

Hindu philosophy is traditionally divided into six âstika (orthodox) schools of thought, or 
darsanan,
which accept

the Vedas as supreme revealed scriptures. The âstika schools are:

1. &  a, an atheistic and strongly dualist theoretical exposition of consciousness and matter.

2. Pcg¥z, a school emphasizing meditation, contemplation and liberation.


   
   


 

3.  a  or logic, explores sources of knowledge (Nyaya Sutras).

4. Idrs zzsT4a, an empiricist school of atomism.

5. ///ua as/, an anti-ascetic and anti-mysticist school of orthopraxy.

6. Idx¥zz 'a, the last segment of knowledge in the Vedas, or the ’Jnan' (knowledge) 'Kanda'

Vedanta came to be the dominant current of Hinduism in the post-medieval period.

Of the historical division into six darsanas, only two schools, Vedanta and Yoga, survive.

1. Samkhya

Samkhya is the oldest of the orthodox philosophical systems in Hinduism. It espouses dualism 
between

consciousness and matter by postulating two "irreducible, innate and independent" realities:

(i) Consciousness itself or Purusha (self, atma or soul)

(ii) Primordial materiality or Prakriti (creative agency or energy).

2Prakriti consists of varying levels of three dispositions or categories of qualities: Activity 
(zztas), Inactivity (/‘aws)

and Harmony (salt ). An imbalance in the intertwined relationship of these three dispositions 
causes the world to

evolve from Prakriti. This evolution from Prakriti causes the creation of 23 constituents, 
including intellect (buddhi),

ego (ahamkara) and mind (manas). Samkhya theorizes the existence of many living souls (Jeevatmas) 
who

possess consciousness, but denies the existence of Ishvara(God).

Samkhya holds that Purusa, the eternal pure consciousness, due to ignorance, identifies itself with 
products of

Prakriti such as intellect (buddhi) and ego (ahamkara). This results in endless transmigration and 
suffering.

However, once the realization arises that Purusa is distinct from Prakriti, the Self is no longer 
subject to

transmigration and absolute freedom (kaivalya) arises.

2. Yoga

The Yoga philosophical system is closely allied with the Samkhya school, but is more theistic than 
the Samkhya.

The foundational text of the Yoga school is the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, who is regarded as the 
founder of the
   
   


 

formal Yoga philosophy. Hindu philosophy distinguishes seven major branches of Yoga:

(i) PdJa Yoga (Classical Yoga), a system of yoga codified by Patañjali and classified as one of the 
six âstika ("orthodox") schools of Hindu philosophy.
(ii) Jzzyze cgzt, (buddhi-yoga) centred on the faculty of discernment and ’virtually identical with 
the spiritual
path of Vedânta’.

(iii) 7 zrm- cgst, in which the world of everyday work becomes the tool by which self is 
transcended.

(iv) 7¥z Y/- Fcgzz the path of devoted service to God.

(v) Tax 'ra-j<gezfocused on the techniques and psycho-physical teachings contained within a body of 
texts
called tantras.

(vi) dzzrza- cgzz, one of the most ancient forms of yoga in which the psycho-acoustical properties 
of the

spoken word are used to concentrate the mind.

(vii) 7 /’&   , a system of physical purification designed to reintegrate and re-balance the mind 
and body
in preparation for Raja-yoga (first described by Yogi Swatmarama).

3. Nyaya

The Nyaya school is based on the Nyaya Sutras. They were written by Aksapada Gautama, probably in 
the second

century BCE. The most important contribution made by this school is its methodology. This 
methodology is based

on a system of logic that has subsequently been adopted by the majority of the Indian schools.

The followers of Nyaya believed that obtaining valid knowledge was the only way to gain release 
from suffering.

According to Nyaya, there are exactly four sources of knowledge: perception, inference, comparison, 
and

testimony. Knowledge obtained through each of these is either valid or invalid.

4. Vaisheshika

The Vaisheshika school postulates an atomic pluralism in which all objects in the physical universe 
are reducible to

certain types of atoms, and Brahman is regarded as the fundamental force that causes consciousness 
in these
   
   


 

atoms. The school was founded by the sage Kanâda (or Kana-bhuk, literally, atom-eater) around the 
2nd century

BC. Major ideas contained in the Vaisheshika Sutra are:

• There are nine classes of realities: four classes of atoms (earth, water, light and air), space 
(akasha), time
(kâla), direction (dik), infinity of souls (Atman), mind (manas).

• Individual souls are eternal and pervade material body for a time.

• There are seven categories (padârtha) of experience: substance, quality, activity, generality, 
particularity,

inherence and non-existence.

Although the Vaisheshika school developed independently from the Nyaya, the two eventually merged 
because of

their closely related metaphysical theories. In its classical form, however, the Vaisheshika school 
differed from the

Nyaya in one crucial respect: where Nyaya accepted four sources of valid knowledge, the Vaisheshika 
accepted

only two  perception and inference.

5. Purva Mimansa

The main objective of the Purva Mimamsa school was to establish the authority of the Vedas.
Consequently, this

school's most valuable contribution to Hinduism was its formulation of the rules of Vedic 
interpretation.
Its

adherents propounded unquestionable faith in the Vedas and regular performance of the yajñas, or 
fire-sacrifices.

They believed in the power of the mantras and yajñas to sustain all the activity of the universe. 
In keeping with this

belief, they placed great emphasis on dharma, which consisted of the performance of Vedic rituals.

The Mimamsa philosophers believed that the other schools of thought that aimed for release (moksha) 
were not

allowed for complete freedom from desire and selfishness, because the very striving for liberation 
stemmed from a

simple desire to be free. According to Mimamsa thought, only by acting in accordance with the 
prescriptions of the

Vedas may one attain salvation. Although Mimamsa does not receive much scholarly attention, its 
influence can be

   
   


 

felt in the life of the practising Hindu, because all Hindu ritual, ceremony, and law is influenced 
by this school.


6. Vedanta

The Vedanta, or later Mimamsa school, concentrates on the philosophical teachings of the Upanishads 
rather than

the ritualistic injunctions of the Brahmanas. These were mystical aspects of Vedic religion that 
focused on

meditation, self-discipline, and spiritual connectivity, more than traditional ritualism. Vedanta 
means, the last

segment of knowledge in the Vedas. While, the earlier segments of the Vedas are called 'Karma 
Kanda'. Parts of

Vedas that focus on spiritual practices such as worship, devotion and meditation are called 
'Upasana Kanda'.

(Kanda = section).

Vedantic thought drew on Vedic cosmology, hymns and philosophy. While thirteen or so Upanishads are 
accepted
as principal, over a hundred exist. The most significant contribution of Vedantic thought is the 
idea that selfconsciousness

is continuous with and indistinguishable from consciousness of Brahman.

The principles of the Vedanta sutras are presented in a cryptic, poetic style, which allows for a 
variety of

interpretations. Consequently, the Vedanta separated into six sub-schools, each interpreting the 
texts
in its own

way and producing its own series of sub-commentaries.



This is the oldest and most widely acknowledged Vedantic school. Advaita means "non-duality." Its 
first great consolidator was Adi Shankaracharya
According to Advaita, Brahman is the only reality, and there exists nothing whatsoever which is not

Brahman. The appearance of dualities and differences in this world is a superimposition on Brahman, 
called Maya. Maya is neither existent nor non-existent, but appears to exist temporarily.



   
   


 

When a person tries to know Brahman through his mind, due to the influence of Maya, Brahman appears
as God (Ishvara), separate from the world and from the individual. In reality, there is no 
difference between

the individual soul (Jivatma) and Brahman (Paramatma).

The spiritual practices such as: devotion to God, meditation & self-less action etc. purifies the 
mind and
indirectly helps in perceiving the real.

The only direct cause of liberation is self-knowledge which directly removes the ignorance. After 
realization, one sees one's own self and the Universe as the same


Vishishtadvaita is means qualified non-dualism. Ramanujacharya was the foremost proponent of the
philosophy of Vishishtadvaita.

Vishishtadvaita advocated the concept of a Supreme Being with essential qualities or attributes.
They are

against the Advaitan philosophy of Brahman as an impersonal empty oneness.

They saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was 
omnipresent
and actively involved in existence. To them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and 
a sign

of ignorance. However, the individual's sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was 
derived from

the universal beingness that is Brahman. Ramanuja He saw Vishnu as a personification of Brahman.



Dvaita Vedanta means the dualistic conclusions of the Vedas. This philosophy was founded by 
Madhvacharya. It propagates the principle of dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate 
realities.
The first and the more important reality is that of Vishnu or Brahman. Vishnu is the supreme Self, 
God, the

   
   


 

absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality.

The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate 
essence.

The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to Advaita Vedanta (monistic conclusion of 
Vedas)
is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls 
the universe.
Dvaita philosophy attempts to address the problem of evil with the idea that souls are not created.

Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections of 
the

divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. Salvation therefore is described as the 
realization that

all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.



Dvaitadvaita was proposed by Nimbarka.

According to this philosophy there are three categories of existence: Brahman, soul, and matter.
Soul and

matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from 
Brahman.

Brahman exists independently, while soul and matter are dependent yet seperate. Further,
Brahman is a

controller, the soul is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed.

The highest object of worship is Krishna and his consort Radha, attended by thousands of gopis,
or

cowherdesses; of the celestial Vrindavana; and devotion consists in self-surrender.



Shuddhadvaita is the "purely non-dual" philosophy propounded by Vallabhacharya.

The Shuddhadvaita principle sees equality in "essence" of the individual self with God. There is no
real

difference between the two. It does not deny God as the whole and the individual as the part. The

individual soul is not the Supreme (Satcitananda) clouded by the force of avidya, but is itself 
Brahman, with
   
   


 

one attribute (ananda) rendered imperceptible.

Unlike Advaita, the world of Maya is not regarded as unreal, since Maya is nothing else than a
power of

Ishvara. He is not only the creator of the universe but is the universe itself.

The followers of Shuddhadvaita are the worshipers of Krishna. They maintain that if one wants to 
obtain
moksha and the bliss given by Krishna, the only path to do so is bhakti.



This is the philosophy of "inconceivable oneness and difference" in relation to the power creation 
and
creator, (Krishna) and also between God and his energies within the Gaudiya Vaishnava religious 
tradition.

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was the founder of this philosophy. He was stating that the soul or energy of 
God
is both distinct and non-distinct from God, whom he identified as Krishna, Govinda, and that this, 
although

unthinkable, may be experienced through a process of loving devotion (bhakti).

Three other nâstika (heterodox) schools don't draw upon the Vedas as the sole primary authoritative 
text, but may
emphasize other traditions of thought. The nâstika schools are:

1. Cârvâka

2. Jainism

3. Buddhism

While Charvaka is classified as a nâstika school, Buddhism and Jainism are also classified as 
nâstika religions

since they do not accept the authority of the Vedas.



Hinduism, otherwise a highly theistic religion, hosted atheistic schools; the thoroughly 
materialistic and antireligious
philosophical Cârvâka (Nastika) school that originated in India around the 6th century BCE is 
probably the most explicitly atheistic school of Indian philosophy. It is not included among the 
six schools of
Hinduism

   
   


 

generally regarded as orthodox. Our understanding of Cârvâka philosophy is fragmentary, based 
largely on

criticism of the ideas by other schools, and it is no longer a living tradition.

Academics categorize contemporary Hinduism into four major denominations: Vaishnavism,
Shaivism, Smartism

and Shaktism. The denominations differ primarily in the god worshipped as the Supreme One and in 
the traditions
that accompany worship of that god.

Vaishnavas worship Vishnu as the supreme God; Shaivites worship Shiva as the supreme; Shaktas 
worship Shakti

(power) personified through a female divinity or Mother Goddess, Devi; while Smartas believe in the 
essential

oneness of five (panchadeva) or six (Shanmata, as Tamil Hindus add Skanda) deities as 
personifications of the

Supreme.

1. Vaishnavism

It is focused on worshiping of Vishnu. Vaishnavites lead a way of life promoting differentiated 
monotheism,
which gives importance to Lord Vishnu and His ten incarnations.

Its beliefs and practices, especially the concepts of Bhakti and Bhakti Yoga, are based largely on 
the
Upanishads, and associated with the Vedas and Puranic texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, and the 
Padma, Vishnu and Bhagavata Puranas.
Awareness, recognition, and growth of the belief have significantly increased outside of India in 
recent
years. The Gaudiya Vaishnava branch of the tradition has significantly increased the awareness of 
Vaishnavism internationally, since the mid-1900s, largely through the activities and geographical 
expansion of the Hare Krishna movement founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in New York 
City in 1966.
2. Shaivism

Shaivism reveres the god Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, 
the

   
   


 

creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is.

Devotees of Shiva wear Sacred ash as a sectarian mark on their foreheads and other parts of their
bodies

with reverence. The Sanskrit words bhasma and vibhuti can both be translated as "sacred ash".

Shaivism has a vast literature that includes texts representing multiple philosophical schools, 
including
non-dualist (abheda), dualist (bheda), and non-dual-with-dualism (bhedâbheda) perspectives.


3. Shaktism

Shaktism focuses focuses worship upon Shakti or Devi — the Hindu Divine Mother —as the absolute,
ultimate Godhead. Shaktism regards Dev as the Supreme Brahman itself, with all other forms of 
divinity,

female or male, considered being merely her diverse manifestations.

In the details of its philosophy and practice, Shaktism resembles Shaivism. However, Shaktas focus 
most
or all worship on Shakti, as the dynamic feminine aspect of the Supreme Divine.

Shaktism is practiced throughout the Indian subcontinent and beyond, in numerous forms, both 
Tantric and

non-Tantric; however, its two largest and most visible schools are the Srikula (lit., family of 
Sri), strongest

in South India, and the Kalikula (family of Kali), which prevails in northern and eastern India.

4. Smartism

Smartism is a liberal or nonsectarian denomination of the Vedic Hindu religion which accepts all 
the major
Hindu deities as forms of the one Brahman.

The term Smarta refers to adherents who follow the Vedas and Shastras. Only a section of south 
Indian
brahmins call themselves Smartas now.

Smartas are followers and propagators of Smriti or religious texts derived from Vedic scriptures.
Smarta

   
   


 

religion was practiced by people who believed in the authority of the Vedas as well as the basic 
premise of

puranas. As a consequence usually only a brahmin preferred to use this term to refer to his family 
tradition.

It is most essential for Smarta Brahmins to specialize in the Karma Kanda of the Vedas and 
associated
rituals diligently, and to teach the subsequent generations.

Varnas

Hindu society has been categorized into four classes, called varnas. They are:

(i) the Brahmins: Vedic teachers and priests;

(ii) the Kshatriyas: warriors, nobles, and kings;

(iii) the Vaishyas: farmers, merchants, and businessmen; and

(iv) the Shudras: servants and labourers

Bhagavad Gita, the sacred text of Hindus, links the varna to an individual's duty (svadharma), 
inborn nature

(svabhâva), and natural tendencies (gupa).

Ashramas

Traditionally the life of a Hindu is divided into four Ashramas (phases or stages).

The first part of one's life, Wa/z ec zzg, the stage as a student, is spent in celibate, 
controlled, sober
and pure contemplation under the guidance of a Guru, building up the mind for spiritual knowledge.

&? as//zz is the householder's stage, in which one marries and satisfies kâma and artha in one's 
married
and professional life respectively.

Yanaprastha, the retirement stage, is gradual detachment from the material world. This may involve 
giving
over duties to one's children, spending more time in religious practices and embarking on holy 
pilgrimages.

Finally, in Sannyasa, the stage of asceticism, one renounces all worldly attachments to secludedly 
find the
Divine through detachment from worldly life and peacefully shed the body for Moksha.


   
   


 

Hindu texts

Hindu literature can be divided into two categories: Shruti - that which is revealed and
Smriti - that which is remembered.

The Vedas coming under the Shruti category are considered sacred scripture. Later texts like the 
various shastras

and the itihaasas form Smruti. Holding an ambiguous position between the Upanishads of the Vedas 
and the epics,

the Bhagavad Gita is considered to be revered scripture by most Hindus today. All Shruti scriptures 
are composed
in Sanskrit.

Hindu Pilgrimage

Important Pilgrimage sites of Hindu devotees are:

/ «z  dé/a One of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every 12 years; the location is 
rotated
among Allahabad, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. It is considered as one of the largest pilgrimage 
gathering

in the world.

z7zzr ZZezzr(Famous Four Pilgrimage sites): The four holy sites Puri, Rameswaram, Dwarka, and 
Badrinath compose the Char Dham (four abodes) pilgrimage circuit.
Od/-flay crimes as per Puranic Texts: Varanasi formerly known as Kashi, Allahabad formerly known as
Prayag, Haridwar-Rishikesh, Mathura-Vrindavan, Pandharpur, Paithan and Ayodhya.

Eli:I? 73ner  Another important set of pilgrimages are the Shakti Peethas, where the Mother Goddess
is worshipped, the two principal ones being Kalighat and Kamakhya.

2. Shramana Traditions

The Shramana movement was a Non-Vedic movement parallel to Vedic Hinduism in ancient India.
The Shramana

tradition gave rise to Jainism, Buddhism, and Yoga, and was responsible for the related concepts of 
samsâra (the

cycle of birth and death) and moksha (liberation from that cycle).

Sramanism, emphasizing thought, hard work and discipline, was one of the three strands of Hindu 
philosophy. The

other two included Brahmanism, which drew its philosophical essence from Mimamsa. The third and 
most popular

strand of Indian philosophical thought revolves around the concept of Bhakti or Theism, based on 
the
idea of God,

as understood in most parts of the world.

Philosophy

Sramapas held a view of samsara as full of suffering (Dukka). They practiced Ahimsa and rigorous 
ascetism. They

believed in Karma and Moksa and viewed rebirth as undesirable. Vedics, on the contrary believe in 
the efficacy of

rituals and sacrifices, performed by a privileged group of people, who could improve their life by 
pleasing certain

Gods. Beliefs and concepts of Sramana philosophies: Denial of creator and omnipotent Gods
Rejection of the Vedas as revealed texts

Affirmation of Karma and rebirth, Samsara and transmigration of Soul.

Affirmation of the attainment of moksa through Ahimsa, renunciation and austerities Denial of the 
efficacy of sacrifices and rituals for purification.
Rejection of the caste system



   
   


 

Jainism and Buddhism are the two main schools philosophies that have continued in India since 
ancient times.
3. Jainism

The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy are its belief on independent existence of soul and 
matter, absence

of a supreme divine creator, potency of karma, eternal and uncreated universe, a strong emphasis on 
non-violence,

morality and ethics based on liberation of soul.

Jainism is the sixth largest religion in India and is followed throughout the India. Lakshadweep is 
the only Union

Territory/state without Jains. Maharashtra has the highest number of Jain Population. Like most 
ancient Indian

religions, Jainism has its roots from the Indus Valley Civilization, reflecting native spirituality 
prior to the Indo-Aryan

migration into India.

Principles of Jainism

Jainism encourages spiritual development through cultivation of one's own personal wisdom and 
reliance on selfcontrol

through vows. Ascetics of this religion undertake five major vows:

1. Ahimsa (Non-violence): The first major vow taken by ascetics is to cause no harm to living 
beings.

It involves minimizing intentional as well as unintentional harm to other living creatures.

2. Satya (Truth): The vow is to always speak of truth. Given that non-violence has priority, other 
principles yield to it whenever there is a conflict. In a situation where speaking truth could lead 
to violence, silence is to be observed.
3. Asteya: Asteya, is to not take into possession, anything that is not willingly offered. Attempt 
to squeeze material wealth from others or exploit the weak is considered theft.
4. Brahmacharya: The vow of brahmacharya requires one to exercise control over senses from 
indulgence in sexual activity.
5. Aparigraha: Aparigraha is to observe detachment from people, places and material things.

Ascetics live a life of complete renunciation of property and human relations.

Jain metaphysics is based on seven or nine fundamentals which are known as Call va. These are an 
attempt to

   
   


 

explain the nature and solution to the human predicament. These are:

J'rxa: The living entities are called Jiva. It is a substance which is different from the body that 
houses it.
Consciousness, knowledge and perception are the fundamental attributes of the Jiva.

/)T va: The non-living entities which consists of matter, space and time falls into the category of 
Ajiva.

Axe a Due to the interaction between the two substances, jTva and ajTva, there is influx of a
special ajiva

called karma into the soul. This karma then sticks to the soul.

ZB  The karma masks the jiva and restricts it from having its true potential of perfect knowledge
and

perception.

fiaa. za Through right conduct, it is possible to stop the influx of additional karma.

IlirJarâ: By performing asceticism, it is possible to shred or burn up the existing karma.

Isle' The jiva which has removed its karma is said to be liberated and have its pure, intrinsic 
quality of
perfect knowledge in its true form.

Authors sometimes add two additional categories: the meritorious and demeritorious acts related to
karma. These

are called /zct a and papa respectively.

Tirtankara

Jainism has been preached by a succession of twenty-four propagators of faith known as 77z/ ezKaza. 
Tirtankara

is a human being who helps in achieving liberation and enlightenment as an "Arihant" by destroying 
all of their soul

constraining (ghati) karmas, became a role-model and leader for those seeking spiritual guidance. 
There are 24

Tirthañkaras and each of them revitalized the Jain Order.

Tirthankara is also said to mean “full moon,” a metaphorical reference to Kevala Jnana. Keval Gnan 
is
a state of



   
   


 

permanent, perpetual, absolute knowledge of the Soul; it is the precursor to moksha, final 
liberation from samsara,

the cycle of birth and death.

Jaina tradition identifies Rishabha (Adinath) as the first tirthankara. The last two tirthankara, 
Parshva and Mahavira
are historical figures whose existence is recorded.

A z2¥z4zazz</? is an emperor of the world and lord of the material realm. Though he possesses 
worldly power, he

often finds his ambitions dwarfed by the enormity of the cosmos. Jaina puruna give a list of twelve 
Chakravarti. One

of the greatest Chakravarti mentioned in Jaina scriptures is Bharata. Tradition says that India 
came to be known as

Bharata-varsha in the memory of this Bharata.

There are nine sets of baladeva, v6sudeva and prati v6sudeva. Baladeva are non-violent heroes.
Vasudeva are

violent heroes and prativâsudeva can be termed as villains. Vasudeva ultimately kills 
prativasudeva.
Baladeva

goes to heaven. On the other hand, vasudeva go to hell on account of their violent exploits, even 
if they were to

uphold righteousness.

Jain sects

In the 4th century CE, Jainism developed two major divisions ZZj; zxzfa<a (sky clad ascetics) and


(white robed ascetics). Both Digambara and Svetambara communities have continued to develop, almost

independently of each other. With the passage of time, both had further sub-sects. Except for some 
minor

differences in rituals and way of life, their belief and practices for the spiritual progress are 
the same.
The four main

sects with a sizable population are Digambara, Svetambara Murtipujaka, Sthanakavasi and Terapanthi.

The Digambaras, like Mahavira, practice total nudity to avoid all attachments. The Shvetambaras 
reject nudity as

an exterior symbol having no significance on their inner spiritual development. They also accepted 
women into the

   
   


 

monastic community early on, unlike the Digambaras.

Jaina Literature

The fourteen Purvas was a body of Jain scriptures preached by tirthankara of Jainism. These 
teachings were

memorized and passed on through ages, but became fairly vulnerable and died off within one thousand 
years after

Lord Mahavira's nirvana (liberation).

Agamas are canonical texts of Jainism based on Mahavira's teachings. Mahavira's preachings were 
orally

compiled by his disciples into various Sutras (texts) which were collectively called Jain canonical 
or Agamic

literature. These Agamas are composed of forty-six texts: twelve angâs, twelve upanga âgamas, six 
chedasutras,

four mulasutras, ten prakTrnaka sutras and two culikasutras.

Svetambaras accept thirty-two to forty-five aagamas, final redaction of which took place at the 
Council of Valabhi

(453 - 466 BCE). Digambaras accept two canonical texts Satkhandaagama and Kasaayapahuda composed in 
2nd

century CE.

Jains had a major influence in developing a system of philosophy and ethics that had a great impact 
on Indian

culture. They have contributed to the culture and language of the Indian states Tamil Nadu, 
Karnataka, Gujarat and

Rajasthan. Jain Rituals
Solar izz'<a is the fundamental prayer of Jainism. In this prayer there is no mention of names, 
including
that of thetirthankara. It does not ask for favors or material benefits, it simply serves as a 
gesture of deep

respect towards beings they believe are more spiritually advanced and to remind followers of the 
Jainism of

their ultimate goal of nirvana.

Jains follow six obligatory duties known as has  atas includes samyika (pracitising serenity),


   
   


 

chaturvimshati (praising tirthankara), vandan (respecting teachers and monks), Pratikramana, 
Kayotsarga,

pratyakhyana (renunciation).

73zx zzs/zaza is one of the most important festivals for the Jains. Normally Svetambara Jains refer 
it
as

Paryushana, while Digambara Jains refer it as Das Lakshana. It is believed that the deva do 
ashtprakari

puja of tirthankara and it takes them eight days to do this ashtaprakari puja. This is called 
Ashtanhika Mahotsav, so at the very same time Jains celebrate it as Paryushan. Paryushana lasts 
eight days for Svetambara Jains and ten days for Digambaras Jains.
Mahavira Jayanti, the birthday of Mahavira, is celebrated on the thirteenth day of the fortnight of 
the waxing
moon, in the month of Chaitra.

A unique ritual in this religion involves a holy fasting until death called &//zsUzazzz Through 
this one
achieves a death with dignity and dispassion as well as a reduction of negative karma to a great 
extent.

This form of dying is also called Gz '/zara.

4. Buddhism

Buddhism is a religion indigenous to the Indian subcontinent that encompasses a variety of 
traditions, beliefs and

practices largely based on teachings attributed to Siddhartha Gautama, who is commonly known as the 
Buddha.

Buddha is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to 
help

sentient beings end suffering (dukkha) through eliminating ignorance (avidyâ) by way of 
understanding and seeing

dependent origination (pratTtyasamutpâda) and eliminating craving (taphâ), and thus attain the 
highest happiness,

nirvâna.

Buddhism reached its peak under the Mauryan Empire (322-185 AD). Ashoka gave royal patronage to 
Buddhism

and made it a pan-Asian religion. He sponsored Buddhist missions to various areas within his empire 
and also to
   
   


 

the Greek-ruled areas of the Northwest, Sri Lanka in the south as well as the Central Asia. After 
the death of

Ashoka, Buddhism did not get a direct royal patronage. Soon Buddhism declined and was almost wiped 
out from

India but instead spread to the South East Asian countries and to Sri Lanka. Gautama Buddha
Siddhârtha Gautama was born in Lumbini in modern-day Nepal, around the year 563 BCE, and raised in

Kapilavastu. Young prince Gautama was kept away from seeing the sufferings of normal people since 
an

astrologer prophesied that he would renounce the material world if sees the miseries of Life. In a 
series of

encounters, known in Buddhist literature as the h<  srj;dds, he learned of the suffering of 
ordinary people,

encountering an old man, a sick man, a corpse and, finally, an ascetic holy man, apparently content 
and at peace

with the world. These experiences prompted Gautama to abandon royal life and take up a spiritual 
quest.

For six years, Siddhartha submitted himself to rigorous ascetic practices, studying and following 
different methods

of meditation with various religious teachers. But he was never fully satisfied. One day, however, 
he was offered a

bowl of rice from a young girl and he accepted it. In that moment, he realised that physical 
austerities were not the

means to achieve liberation. From then on, he encouraged people to follow a path of balance rather 
than

extremism. He called this Zoe fof:d'e /y'

At the age of 35, Siddhartha sat under the Bodhi tree, in the town of Bodh Gaya in India, and 
meditated. He purified

his mind of all defilements and attained enlightenment after many days, thus earning the title 
Buddha,
or

"Enlightened One".

Thereafter, he attracted a band of followers and instituted a monastic order. He spent the rest of 
his life teaching

the path of awakening he had discovered, traveling throughout the north-eastern part of the Indian 
subcontinent,
   
   


 

and died at the age of 80 (483 BCE) in Kushinagar, India.

Principles

&zzzaza is "the cycle of birth and death". Sentient beings crave pleasure and are averse to pain 
from birth to
death. Buddhists strive to end the sufferings by eradicating the causes and conditions, applying 
the methods laid

out by the Buddha and subsequent Buddhists.

/ zrm in Buddhism is the force that drives samsâra. Good, skillful deeds (kusala) and bad, 
unskillful (akusala)

actions produce "seeds" in the mind that come to fruition either in this life or in a subsequent 
rebirth.
The avoidance

of unwholesome actions and the cultivation of positive actions is called 5r/a.

7Z'Zrx/ r refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many 
possible forms of
sentient life, each running from conception to death. Buddhism rejects the concepts of a permanent 
self or an

unchanging, eternal soul, as it is called in Hinduism and Christianity. Each rebirth takes place 
within
one of five

realms according to Theravadins, or six according to other schools. These are further subdivided 
into 31 planes of

existence.


Branches of Buddhism

Two branches of Buddhism are generally recognized: Mahayana ("The Great Vehicle") and Theravada 
("The
School of the Elders")

7IU'7 z az¥z The followers of Mahayana believe that Buddha taught universal salvation. One should 
not aim
at personal nirvana and should help ease the suffering of humanity. Mahayana Buddhism is found

throughout East Asia (China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan etc.) and includes the 
traditions of

Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism, Shingon, and Tiantai (Tendai). In India, this 
form


   
   


 

of Buddhism is followed in Ladakh, Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh.

7Zeraczdz The Theravada Buddhism is better known as the earliest form of Buddhism. The ‘Thera’
means

old and ‘Vada’ means school. The aim of this form of Buddhism is to attain personal nirvana through 
the

triple recourse to ethical conduct, mental discipline and higher knowledge or wisdom. It has a 
widespread

following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar etc.). In India, this 
strain of

Buddhism is represented by the followers of Dr B.R.Ambedkar known as the Ambedkar Buddhists, who 
are

exclusive to India.

In some classifications, +y^ x•zza practiced mainly in Tibet and Mongolia, and adjacent parts of 
China and Russia

is recognized as a third branch. 7 'ze za is an ugly Mahayana polemical term coined by Mahayanists 
to both
classify and refer to those schools of Buddhism with which the Mahayana disagreed.

The Four Noble Truths

The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism. These 
four truths

explain the nature of dukkha, its causes, and how it can be overcome. They can be summarized as 
follows:

1. The truth of dukkha (suffering, anxiety, dissatisfaction): explains the nature of dukkha.

2. The truth of the origin of dukkha: It says that the origin of dukkha can be known. The origin of 
dukkha is

commonly explained as craving conditioned by ignorance. On a deeper level, the root cause of dukkha 
is

identified as ignorance.

3. The truth of the cessation of dukkha: It says that the complete cessation of dukkha is possible.

4. The truth of the path leading to the cessation of dukkha: It identifies a path to cessation of 
dukkha.







   
   


 

Noble Eightfold Path

The Noble Eightfold Path consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions, that when 
developed

together, lead to the cessation of dukkha. The Eight factors are:

1. 77j;dd her/m 7Zj;dz* Mo6'<sz’az¥ 'zgj/. Viewing reality as it is, not just as it appears to be

? 77j;d ' /z 'e/z’?o7 {m 77j;dd 7Zaacgddg. Intention of renunciation, freedom and harmlessness '. 
7Zj;d '   A. Speaking in a truthful and non-hurtful way
â 7Zj; "  /zxz. Acting in a non-harmful way

5. 77j;dd Zine/77xxz A non-harmful livelihood

6. 7Zj;d ' &/m/. Making an effort to improve

Z 7Zj;dd /'  zr/   Awareness to see things for what they are with clear consciousness

8. 7Zj;d ' z2xrwY<a/rcrr Correct meditation or concentration, explained as the first four jhânas 
Practices
The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the   , the ZZzz<m (the 
teachings),
and the &xgz a (the community). Taking "refuge in the triple gem" has traditionally been a 
declaration and
commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-
Buddhist. Other

practices may include following ethical precepts; support of the monastic community; renouncing 
conventional

living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; 
cultivation of higher

wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana 
tradition,

invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.

The Buddhist place of worship is called a If7¥z<a or bgzzz, which usually houses one or more 
statues of the
Buddha. The five great events in Buddha's life are represented by symbols as under:

(i) Birth by Zz¥'zxs azz7'ZS'//

(ii) Great Renunciation by Use


   
   


 

(iii) Nirvana by   free

(iv) First Sermon by ZZ¥zxwc/zz4xa or Wheel

(v) Parinirvana or death by the &zz,oz.

Dharmachakra

The Wheel of Law or dharmachakra, is the most important symbol of Buddhism. According to the 
Buddha, dharma

is the law that ensures the welfare of the greatest number of people if practiced faithfully. The 
wheel symbolises the

goodness in every person. The wheel has eight spokes representing the eight virtues enumerated by 
the Eight Fold

Path, the path to salvation.

Tibetan Buddhism

The Tibetan Buddhism is "essentially Buddhism of the Mahayana school, with elements of modified 
Shaivism and

native ritualistic shamanism". Monks belonging to this strain of Buddhism are called laws. Tibetan 
Buddhism, also

called Zazsrsm is a predominant religion of Tibet, Mongolia and other parts of the world. In India 
it is practised by

over 1,20,000 Tibetans settled in their different settlements at Dharamsala, Dehradun (UP),
Kushalnagar

(Karnataka), Darjeeling (West BengaI),ArunachaI Pradesh, Sikkim and Ladakh.

The Tibetan Buddhism follows a strict code of traditional hierarchy. The supreme position is 
occupied by two lamas:

the Z2z/ar Zam (Grand Lama) and the /bxxzWzz Zazzs (Bogodo Lama). Of the two, the Dalai Lama is
more

powerful and is considered as the spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism, while the Panchen Lama is the 
second most

senior religious authority. Next in rank are the Hutukhtus, or spiritual dignitaries. The Rimpoches 
or Hobilghans or

bodhisattvas form the third level of authority.

The present and the 14tx Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was identified and enthroned in 1940, in Lhasa. 
After the

Chinese annexation of Tibet in 1950, the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 and established a 
Government-in-exile at

   
   


 

Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh.

5. Sikhism

Sikhism began about 500 years ago by Guru Nanak and preaches a message of devotion and remembrance 
to

God at all times, truthful living and equality of mankind and denounces superstitions and blind 
rituals.
Sikhism is

open to all through the teachings of its 10 Gurus enshrined in the Sikh Holy Book,  Cazz"/z zzr &/




Principles of Sikhism

Sikhs believe that God is Monistic or Non-dual. He is the creator of the Universe, whose existence 
and continued

survival depends on His will. God is both Saguna (with attributes) and Nirguna (without attributes) 
and is called by

names such as Sat (truth), Sat Guru (true Guru), Akal Purkh (timeless being), Kadar(creator) and
Wahi-Guru

(praise to the God).

The belief in the ten Gurus - spiritual guides who dispel ignorance and darkness is the essential 
element of Sikh

religion. According to it the only way to achieve liberation (mukti) from the cycle of birth and 
death is by being Godconscious

(gurmukh).

The Khalsa and five K's

The concept of Khalsa, literally meaning ‘the pure', was introduced by Guru Gobind Singh. He 
established this new

fraternity with five followers (later known as Panj Pyares), who were baptized with amrit as 
Khalsas.
The Khalsa

symbolised coalescence of serenity and strength, purity and power, shastra (scripture) and shastra 
(weapon), and

the power of wisdom (jnana shakti) and the power of action (kriya shakti).

It was made obligatory for every Sikh to wear the Five K's - Kesha (long hair), Kangha (comb), Kara 
(steel

bracelet), Kaccha (short drawers) and Kirpan (sword). Sri Guru Granth Sahib
   
   


 

The Guru Granth Sahib (also known as the Adi Granth) is considered the Supreme Spiritual Authority 
and Head of

the Sikh religion. It is a collection of devotional hymns and poetry which proclaims God, lays 
stress on meditation

on the True Guru (God) and lays down moral and ethical rules for development of the soul, spiritual 
salvation and

unity with God.

The writings of the Gurus appear chronologically. Each of the Gurus signed their hymns as 7Bzed
Guru Granth

Sahib has 3,384 hymns, of which Guru Nanak Dev contributed 974 hymns including sloks and pauris.
It also

contains Bhagatas of Kabir, Namdev, Ravidas, Sheikh Farid, Trilochan, Dhanna, Beni, Sheikh Bhikan, 
Jaidev,

Surdas, Parmanand, Pipa and Ramanand. The fifth Guru Arjan Dev began the great task of collection
of the holy

compositions as Sri (Amritsar) and compiled the Holy Granth Sahib.

6. Islam

The religion of Islam teaches that in order to achieve true peace of mind and surety of heart, one 
must submit to

God and live according to His Divinely revealed Law. The word ’Muslim' means one who submits to the 
will of God,

regardless of their race, nationality or ethnic background.

Muslims believe that all of God's prophets which include Abraham, Noah, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, 
brought

the same message of Pure Monotheism. For this reason, Prophet Muhammad is not considered as the 
founder of a

new religion, as many people mistakenly think, but he was the Final Prophet of Islam.

Principles of Islam

According to traditional Islamic belief, the religion has existed since time immemorial. Allah, the 
AImighty God,

created Adam (the father of the human progeny) out of a lump of clay and commanded the angels to 
greet him with

a ’Sijda’ (prostration in humility). All the angels obeyed the command with the exception of Iblis 
(the Satan). This



   
   


 

resulted in Satan's condemnation and Allah commanded that whosoever followed the Satan's path will 
forfeit His

pleasure and that his abode will be in the fire of hell eternally. Basic Islamic Beliefs are:
(i) had  This means, believe in One, Unique, Incomparable God Who is the Creator, the Ruler and the 
Sustainer of the universe, and none has the right to be worshipped but He alone
(ii) Belief in the existence of Angels of God as the honoured creatures

(iii) Belief in God's Revealed Books

(iv) Belief in the Prophets and Messengers of God

(v) Belief in the Day of Judgement and Life after Death

(vi) Belief in Predestination - God's complete authority over human destiny Main sects of Islam
The followers of Muslim are divided into two main sects: had  azzz’   . Though essentially 
following the same
beliefs and tenets, they differ on two points: the succession to Prophet Muhammad, and the 
religious authority in

Islam after him.

Phszzzis a minority branch of Islam which makes up about one tenth of the total population of the 
Muslim world.
The Shiites form an important part of the population in a number of Arab countries like Iraq, 
Bahrain, Lebanon and

Iran. The Shiahs consider Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet as his rightful heir. They maintain 
that Ali was the first

legitimate Imam or Khalifah (Caliph) and therefore reject Abu Bakr, Omar and Usman, the first three 
Khalifahs of

the Sunni Muslims, as usurpers. There are two main shiite sects:
(i) The ”7"ue/ ners” are by far the largest group of Shiah Islam. They believe that the line of Ali 
became extinct with aI-Askari, the Twelfth Imam, who mysteriously disappeared in 873 AD. They 
however refuse to accept that aI-Askari died and believe that he will appear shortly before the end 
of the world.
(ii) The /st/ries  &ve s are the second largest shiite sect. Their spiritual leader is the Aga
   
   


 

Khan. The Ismailites only recognize the seven first Imams.

Chszzzis the main branch of Islam and recognizes the legitimacy of the first four Khalifahs or 
Caliphs. The
Sunnis believe that the office of the Prophet was not hereditary and no one could claim to be his 
sole heir. The

community chooses one amongst themselves as their leader or the Khalifah.

There are four orthodox sects among the Sunni Muslims i.e. 7dzze/has (followers of Imam Abu 
Hanifah),  /r a/z

(followers of Imam Ash-Shafii), id/air A (followers of Imam Malik) and /d'xdzz/?ja/z (followers of 
Imam Ahmed
Bin Hanbal).

Khalifah

The word Caliph or Khalifah, means ’successor' or 'deputy’. It is used to designate the Prophet's 
successor as

leader of the Muslim community. This title was used by the successive Arab empires and by the 
Ottoman sultans.

The Ottoman Caliphate was maintained for two years after the abolition of the Sultanate, until it 
was itself abolished

by Kemal Ataturk in February 1924.

Prophets of Islam

According to Islamic belief, Allah has sent various Prophets to the world at different times and 
different places to

guide the people on the righteous path.

The names of the following Prophets are mentioned in the Holy Quran: Adam, Sheth, Idris, Nuh 
(Noah), Hud, Salih,
Lut, Ibrahim (Abraham), Ismail, Ishaq (Isaac), Yaqub (Jacob), Yusuf (Joseph), Shuaib, Dawud 
(David), Sulaiman

(Solomon), Ilyas, Al-Yasa (Elisha), Musa (Moses), Aziz (Ubair or Ezra), Ayyub (Job), Dhul-Kifl 
(Isaih or Kharqil Bin

Thauri), Yunus (Jonah), Zakariya (Zachariah), Yahya (John the Baptist), Isa (Jesus Christ) and 
Muhammad.

Prophet Muhammad

Prophet Muhammad is considered as the messenger of Allah and the last of all Prophets who restored 
Islam to its

   
   


 

pristine purity. Prophet Muhammad was born in 570 AD at tha7z At the age of 40, Prophet Muhammad 
received

his first revelation from Allah through the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel) in a cave at Mount Hira near 
Makkah.
The

revelations continued for 23 years, and they are collectively known as the zgzz .

He began preaching these revelations to the common populace in Makkah. Due to sever opposition from 
the

unbelievers, Prophet Muhammad and his followers undertook the great migration or V/ra to a town 
called Yathrib,
which later came to be known as Medina. This emigration marks the beginning of the Muslim Calendar.

In Medina, Islam began to flourish and Prophet Muhammad died at the age of 63. As a mark of respect 
to the

Prophet, the Muslims use the words 'Peace Be Upon Him’ after his name. Islam in India
Islam first came to India at the Malabar Coast of Kerala through Arab traders as early as 6 AD.
Several centuries

later the local population that embraced Islam became a well-knit social and cultural group known 
as the was.

Within the next 200 years, the first Muslim empire, the Delhi Sultanate, was established in India 
with its capital in

Delhi. This was followed by several other Muslim dynasties like the Khiljis, the Tughlaqs, the 
Lodis and the

Mughals. The period of the Mughals was the golden age of Islam in India. The religion flourished 
under the Mughal

rule and many Indians embraced Islam. Today Muslims constitute about 12% of India's population
and are

concentrated largely in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and 
Kashmir.

7. Sufism

Sufism or /asaio«d°, as it is called in Arabic, is generally understood by scholars and Sufis to be 
the inner,

mystical, or psycho-spiritual dimension of Islam. Today, however, many Muslims and non-Muslims 
believe that

Sufism is outside the sphere of Islam.

   
   


 

The Origin

The origins of Sufism can be traced to the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad, whose teachings 
attracted a group of

scholars who came to be called be   ie”, the People of Suffe, from their practice of sitting at the
platform of

the mosque of the Prophet in Medina. There they engaged themselves in discussions concerning the
reality of

‘Being’, and in search of the inner path and devoted themselves to spiritual purification and 
meditation. These

individuals were the founders of Sufism.

Fundamental principles

Sufis represented the inner side of the Islamic creed, which stresses on self-realisation, 
beautification
of the soul

through piety, righteousness and universal love for all. The Sufis consider that there is a 
particular Divine Attribute

that dominates the being of every prophet and saint, such that they can be said to be the 
incarnation of that

attribute. The aim of Sufism is the cultivation of Perfect Beings who are mirrors reflecting the 
Divine Names and

Attributes.

In Sufism, a perfect being is also called a W/? (saint), a word that literally means 'sincere 
friend'. The superstructure of Sufism is built upon the concept of teacher, @z or zm'rsTé’
Sufism had succeeded in inculcating the sentiments of fraternity, equality and equity, coupled with 
sense of service
to humanity, in the followers, irrespective of race, community, caste, creed and colour.

In India, Sufism helped in maintaining communal harmony and social stability by advocating 
religious tolerance

and by borrowing spiritual techniques and practices from other religions. Sufism has adapted 
extensively from

the Vedanta school of the Hindu philosophy.

Sama

The musical and ecstatic aspect of Sufism is called Sama. This is a particular kind of devotional 
dance akin to Kirtana and was introduced by Jalaluddin Rumi. The Sufi, while

   
   


 

being spiritually enraptured, gives the attention of his or her heart to the Beloved. With 
particular movements and often special and rhythmical music, he engages in the selfless remembrance 
of God.
Sufis identify two types of Sama poetry:

1. First praising God (this is called Hamd), Prophet (this is called Naat) and the Sufi saints 
(this is called WmZe '.g
2. The second focussing on spiritual emotion or mystical love, ecstatic states and on separation 
and union.

The Sama poetry is mostly sung in the form of Qawwali. Music of Sama is set within metric 
framework,

accompanied by Dholak, Tabla, Sarangi, Harmonium and Sitar.

8. Muslim Religious Movements

Dawoodi Bohras

The word 'Bohra' is derived from the Gujarati word vohorvu or vyavahar meaning "to trade". The 
Muslim community

of Daudi Bohras traces its ancestry to early conversions to Ismaili Shiism during the reign of the 
Fatimid Caliph

Imam, aI-Mustansir (1036-1094 AD). When schisms occurred in the Ismaili dawah (mission) in the 
eleventh and

twelfth centuries in Egypt, the Ismailis in India followed the Fatimid Tayyibi dawah of Yemen.
Subsequently, this

community split a number of times to form the Jafari Bohras, Daudi Bohras, Sulaymani Bohras, Aliyah 
Bohras and
other lesser-known groups.

The religious hierarchy of the Daudi Bohras is essentially Fatimid and is headed by the  zm'/ap’ 
who is

appointed by his predecessor in office. The dai appoints two others to the subsidiary ranks of zzaz 
¥ y (licentiate)

and zm'4as?z (executor). These positions are followed by the rank of shall and zs’/laid, both of 
which are held by

hundreds of Bohras. An Ax¥/ leads the local congregation in religious, social and communal affairs.
Each town

has a mosque and an adjoining jamaat-khanah (assembly hall) where socio-religious functions are 
held.
   
   


 

The Bohras recognize the seven pillars of Islam. Walayah (love and devotion) for Allah, the 
Prophets, the imam

and the dai is the first and most important of the seven pillars. The others are tahrah (purity & 
cleanliness), salat

(prayers), zakat (purifying religious dues), saum (fasting), haj (pilgrimage to Mecca) and jihad 
(holy war).

The Bohras enjoy a great degree of social and religious cohesion. Every Bohra is required to take 
an oath of

allegiance (J/'saag}, which is a formal initiation into the faith. The oath, inter alia, commits a 
Bohra towards
adherence to the Shariah and accepting the leadership of the Sayyidna and the dai.

The cult of & ?z¥zz, the high priest, and the 7 ' ez, the clergy, is deeply ingrained in the Bohra 
psyche. Every
Bohra follows a system of tax payment to the Syedna, who also exercises a great control over the 
marriage and

death rites. Another distinctive feature is their use of a /g'/rx¥o’/zzzzar ca/ezx 'x which fixes 
the number of days in
each month.

Wahabism

Wahabism was the first great modern expression of the awakening of the Arab Islam in the 18th 
century. Its

founder was Muhammad Ibn Abd-aI-Wahab. He preached and propagated the "pure faith" based only
on the Holy

Quran and the Sunnah and criticised the loosening of moral standards under foreign influences. 
Wahabism led in

1932 to the creation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The only other Wahabi state is Qatar.

The Wahabis do not receive the decisions of the four orthodox sects, but say that any man who can 
read and

understand the Quran and the Ahadith can judge for himself in the matters of doctrine. They do not 
offer prayers to

any prophet, wali, pir or saint. They do not even perform any act of reverence at the Prophet's 
mosque at Madina.

They observe only four main festivals, namely, Idul-Fitr, Idul-Azha, Yaum Al-Ashura and the 
Lailat-al Qadr and do

not observe Prophet Muhammad's birthday (MiIad-un-Nabi) as a festival.

   
   


 

9. Christianity

Christianity is the religion of the followers of the teachings of Jesus Christ. Christianity has 
the largest adherents all

over the world numbering more than 1.5 billion.

Origin

Jesus Christ was born as a Jew in Bethlehem in 4 BC. He was believed to have possessed supernatural 
powers.

He began travelling widely and preaching to people in various towns. Alarmed by the growing 
popularity of Jesus

Christ and his preaching, some Jewish priests conspired to kill him and succeeded in having him 
crucified. On the

third day after his Crucifixion, Jesus was resurrected. He lived on earth for another 40 days and 
then ascended to

heaven.

The incidents preceding and succeeding his birth matched the prophesies of the Old Testament, 
according to

which, the son of God would be born on the earth to rid humanity of its sins. The followers of 
Jesus formed a new

faith, which was named as A?s/?aze'/ (after Christ) and its followers, O?s/raw.

Fundamental principles of Christianity

Christians are monotheists and insist that the originator and preserver of creation is one but is 
represented in the

Holy Trinity, as the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Christians see God as the Lord of Israel 
and the father of

the divine and human figure of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, was the eternal word of God who assumed 
human form

to serve humanity and to rescue the human beings. Jesus Christ suffered and died to redeem mankind 
from sin.

Christians also believe that Jesus Christ now sits at the right hand of God as the final judge of 
the dead, and that

He will return again as prophesised.

Christians believe that Jesus Christ chose 12 learned men as messengers and directed them to spread 
his

teachings and guide the populace. The 12 apt/es are Peter (Simon); his brother Andrew; James; and 
his brother

   
   


 

John; Philip and Bartholomew, the sons of Zebedee; Thomas and Matthew; James, son of AIphaaeus; 
Thaddaeus;

Simon the Patriot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ.

Bible

The holy book of the Christians is the Bible. The Bible contains a collection of writings dating 
from 9 BC to 1 AD

written in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek and English. The Bible is divided into the Old Testament with 46 
books and the

New Testament with 27. The 7'd’ Tesfanez ' is a Hebrew text, sacred to both the Jews and Christians 
and

contains information about the creation of the world. The life and teachings of Jesus Christ, which 
form the centre

of Christian belief, are recorded in the 7Ié'w Tesfaz›ez '.

Christian sects

Christianity became the formal religion of the Roman Empire after Constantine, the Emperor of Rome, 
converted to

Christianity in 313 AD. The religion was known as zgz/O/c or universal, with the Roman Pope as its 
head. By

1054 AD many differences arose and the Church formally split into the ZBsYarzz zZ//aasIzr and the
western

72z/zszz /gz/O?c schools.

In the 15th century, a new school of philosophy began to question the supremacy of the Pope. In the 
16th century

Martin Luther advocated many reforms in the Church, which led to yet another split in the Christian 
community and

the formation of &z¥’esz’azz’ churches across Northeast Europe. The Protestants disapproved of the 
authority of the
Pope and advanced the cause of the Bible as the sole authority.

Christianity in India

By tradition, Christianity is said to have arrived in South India with the arrival of St. Thomas, 
one of the apostles of

Jesus Christ, at the Malabar Coast in 52 AD. He spent some years in South India and died near 
Madras. However,



   
   


 

others believe that the first missionary to arrive in the country was Saint Bartholomew. 
Historically,
Christian

missionary activity started with the advent of St. Francis Xavier in 1544 AD.


Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries Catholic as well as Protestant missionaries preached 
Christian doctrines in

India and also made important contributions to social improvement and education in India.

The great period of expansion of Christianity in India began in 1858, when the British government 
took over rule in

India from the East India Company. Christians from many countries came as missionaries.

At present Christians are scattered all across India but most of them are concentrated in the 
Northeast and in

Kerala and other southern states. Today, there are 23 dioceses in India with 11 of them being 
located in Kerala.



The Christians belonging to the Syrian Church are found in South India and claim an apostolic 
foundation for their Church.
They believe that Christianity was introduced in India by St. Thomas in 52 AD at the Malabar
Coast. He

established seven Christian communities or churches in Kerala.

The Malabar Church renounced the authority of the Pope and asserted its independence in 1653 AD.
This is known in history as the  2zxzev Nos  Zoe/a<a/7crz‘.

The Christian communities then split into many groups - East Syrian Catholics, West Syrian 
Catholics,
Syrian Orthodox, Jacobite Syrian Orthodox, Marthoma, Church of the East and the Latin Church.

Today, the Chaldean Syrian Church is one of four archbishoprics in the Assyrian Church of the East,
and has about 15,000 members in and around Thrissur City. Its cathedral is the Mart Mariam 
Cathedral, Thrissur City's first Christian church.



   
   


 

With the arrival of the Portuguese to India, the visits of Roman Catholic Missions to India became 
more
organised, and were initially concentrated to Goa, Cochin, Tuticorin and other coastal areas.

St. Francis Xavier (1506-52 AD) became the first Jesuit missionary to arrive in India.

In 1557 AD, Pope Paul IV declared Goa an archdiocese with its supremacy extending from the Cape of
Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa to China, and all Christians, including the East Syrian 
Church, brought under its jurisdiction.


The first Protestant missionaries, German Lutherans, came to India in 1706 AD at Tranquebar, near
Tiruchinapally, under the protection of the King of Denmark.

By the 19th century several other missions were established in different parts of South India.



Some consider that St. Thomas had travelled to North India and introduced Christianity. Others 
consider it to be the influence of merchants from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.
Under the influence of the Portuguese, several missionaries began to visit North India between 
16th-
18th Centuries. The Jesuit missions were sent regularly to the Mughal Courts from the time of Akbar 
to

that of Aurangzeb.

William Carey arrived in India in 1793 AD. Carey's pioneering work in Bible translation, primary

education and journalism had a profound influence in Bengal and other parts of India. Numerous 
other
missionaries began visiting India after the passing of Charter Acts by the British Parliament in 
1813 and 1833 AD.
10. Judaism

Judaism is one of the oldest religions of the world, evolved in Egypt about 3,700 years ago. It 
believes in the unity


   
   


 

and oneness of the universal Creator. Judaism is the religion, philosophy and way of life of the 
Jewish people.

HistOry

According to Jewish tradition,  a emwas the leader of a tribe named Habiru (Hebrew) in Chaldea in
about 2000 BC. He advocated the theory of monotheism and decided to move his tribe to Canaan

(Palestine) to propound his theory. Here, the Hebrews mixed freely with local people and eagerly 
sought
converts to their faith.

Abraham's grandson Jacob had an encounter with a mysterious being who told Jacob that in future, 
his
name would be known as ’/srae/’. The renamed Israel had 12 sons, who later became the progenitors 
of

12 tribes named after them. These tribes bore the collective name of   /szae/ or 'Children of 
Israel’.

The Israelis grew in number and for approximately two centuries dwelt in Egypt, where they were 
enslaved.
In about 1200 BC, under the leadership of Ares, they escaped and wandered in the wastes of Sinai 
(Egypt) for a long time. Here, Moses, the first Prophet of god, received revelation of the law, the 
ten Qruszz:dzez¥'s, which is today known as the &/ez Noah, the Jewish scripture.
After this, a kingdom was founded in Canaan with Jerusalem as its capital. In this city, a temple 
was built to
perform sacred rites.

After King Solomon died, Israel was split into two kingdoms. The Southern Kingdom was made up of 
the
tribes of Judah and Benjamin and called Judah with Jerusalem as its capital.

The remaining 10 tribes comprised the Northern Kingdom. When the Assyrians invaded the Northern
Kingdom, they scattered the Israelites to various parts of their empire, northeast of Israel. Today 
they are

referred to as the Z  /as/ /’z/  . The Scriptures suggest they will be identified and returned to 
Israel in the

   
   


 

Last Days.

Beliefs and practices

The Jews believe in one god as was instituted by Abraham, Who they call Ca7 'l and from whom all 
creation
flows. Judaism believes in prophets, of whom Moses was the first. According to tradition, Moses 
received the Ten

Commandments from God. Every devout Jew follows these commandments till today.

The religion gives great importance to a good moral life and does not advocate asceticism, celibacy 
or self-imposed

suffering, as it believes that the path to salvation is only through good deeds.

The religious scripture &/ex Tmah consists of the first five books of the Old Testament. There are 
613 percepts in
the Torah to regulate the daily life of every Jew and this number is symbolised in the threads of 
the prayer shawls

(is/s//’ that every adult male Jew is enjoined to wear for prayers. The 7"a/zzao', the body of 
Jewish law, is
considered Yahweh's exclusive and immutable law. The @    is the Jewish place of worship.

Jewish sects

The Jews have three principle sects: Orthodox, Conservative, and Reformist.

The &//xx¥zr cling to all ancient traditions and forms of religious worship and practices

The founder of the 7g'/mzzzmovement adopted the philosophy of changing with the times, and 
religious
services and rituals were considerably shortened.

The 6trzser /? ze Jews followed a middle path, retaining some features of the Orthodox groups but
permitting relaxation in certain cases.

Judaism in India

It is commonly accepted that the Jews have been in India for over 2,000 years ever since they first
landed on the

West coast of India. The Indian Jews are known as a peace-loving community. They follow the Hebrew 
calendar.



   
   


 

The Indian Jews have a special thanks giving ceremony known as ZZr a7 x to-7B@zzr i.e. ’gratitude 
to Elijah the

Prophet’, on festive occasions. Indian Jews fall into five categories:

1. Bene Israel — meaning Children of Israel. Marati speaking. Arrived in Maharashtra 2,100 years 
ago.

2. Cochin Jews - arrived in India 2,500 years ago and settled down in Kerala as traders.

3. Baghdadi Jews - Jews who came to India as traders from West Asia, mainly from Baghdad. They are

settled mainly in Mumbai, Pune and Kolkata.

4. Bene Menashe - The Manipur Jews constitute a community which sees itself as descendants of the

Manasseh (Menashe) Tribe (which is one of the 10 lost tribes of Jews).

5. Bene Ephraim - also called "Telugu Jews". They are a small group who speak Telugu. Their 
observance

of Judaism dates to 1981.

11. Zoroastrianism

Parsism or Zoroastrianism is about 2600 years old and finds its origin in Persia. The religion was 
founded by

Spenta Zarathustra or Zoroaster, who is considered as the Prophet of the Parsis.
Zoroastrian practice is based on the responsibility of every man and woman to choose between good 
and evil, and to respect God's creations.
Zarathustra preached the oneness of god and believed that dna  7fdzz¥z was the one and only god, 
who is formless and has six great aspects called the  S- eas. These are Ardibehest, Bahman, 
Shahrivar, Spendarmad, Khordad and Amardad. The Parsis believe that the Ahura Mazda is eternally in 
conflict with
a W?z¿pzr or Ahirman, who represents the evil force.

Practices

The Parsi place of worship is called the //xe /exp 'e. Five daily prayers, usually hymns or z ' zs 
uttered by
Prophet Zarathustra are said in the home or the temple, before a fire, which symbolizes the realm 
of truth,

   
   


 

righteousness and order. Fire is regarded as the son of Ahura Mazda, and represents god.

In Zorastriniasm, Z2z4 zus-zzas zz is the only method of corpse-destruction. This involves the 
destruction of the
dead body in the stone-enclosed Dakhma, by the flesh-eating bird or the rays of the Sun.

Religious Scriptures

'ezx s Pes/a is the religious scripture of the Parsis. It contains the teachings, sermons and 
prayers composed by

Prophet Zoroaster and his disciples and followers. Avestha is also the name of the language in 
which it is

composed.

It is divided into five parts: the Yasna (worship with ceremony and offerings), the Videvdad (laws 
against demons),

the Yashts (worship), the Khordeh Avestha, which comprises of selected portions of the Avestha and 
forms the

book of daily prayers of the Zoroastrians, and the five Gathas - Ahunavaiti, Ushtavaiti, Spenta- 
Mainyu, Vohu-
Khshathra and Vashishta-lshti, which contain the 17 hymns of God received by Prophet Zarathushtra 
by way of a

Divine Revelation.

Sects

There are three principle sects among the Parsis: Shahenshai, Kadmi and Fasli. The only difference 
between the

three sects is the calendar they adhere to.

The lbs/is follow the traditional Persian calendar
The  7 a s eds calculate their calendar from the last Sassanian king, Yazdegard III The / ¥zfs 
claim their calendar is the oldest and most accurate.

Zoroastrians of India

The first Zoroastrians to enter India arrived on the Gujarat coast in the 10th century and by the 
17th century, most

of them had settled in Bombay. Today, there are approximately 90,000 Parsis in India and are 
concentrated largely

in Maharashtra and Gujarat.

   
   


 

12. The Bahai Faith

The Bahai Faith is a monotheistic religion founded by A/z'2’zz’//âA in 19th-century Persia. The 
Bahais believe that
the ‘Promised One’ of all ages and peoples, Bahâ’u’llâh revealed himself in 1863. He dispatched one 
of the

distinguished Bahai teachers, Jamal Effendi to India to spread the teachings of the Bahai faith in 
the years 1874-

75.

Beliefs and practices

The Bahais believe in the three cardinal principles - oneness of mankind, oneness of God and 
oneness of religion.

Bahais believe that throughout history the Creator has educated humanity through a series of Divine

Manifestations. These Manifestations include: Krishna, Buddha, Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Jesus and

Muhammad. They believe that in the present age, God has revealed Himself through Bahaullah, whose 
name

means ‘The Glory of God’. He is regarded as their Prophet.

The Bahais work for the removal of prejudices based on caste, creed, religion, sex, colour, race 
and language.

They advocate universal education and the inculcation of a scientific outlook among people. The
Bahais do not

believe in superstitions, ceremonies, rituals and dogmas.

The Bahais pray to the one true God, the Creator of the universe. The act of praying is described 
as




It is obligatory for every Bahai to pray and meditate on the Words of God every day. There are 
prayers for all

occasions and these can be offered individually or collectively.

The Lotus Temple

The Bahai House of Worship at New Delhi is popularly known as the Lotus Temple. The temple gives 
the impression of a half-open lotus flower afloat, surrounded by its leaves. There is no clergy in 
the temple, no idols, no pictures, no sermons, no rituals. It is a place for communication between 
man and his Creator, God.
   
   


 

The shrine has been designed by a young architect, if'. W<r  z &  , a Canadian citizen and a Bahai 
of Iranian descent, who was selected from among the world's top architects.
2. Religious Pilgrimages of India

Amarnath Yatra

The Cave of Amarnath is about 50 kilometers from Pahalgam in south Kashmir but

involves tough walking, trekking and pony-riding. The cave is surrounded by snowy mountains. The 
cave itself is covered with snow most time of the year except for a short period of time in summer 
when it is open for pilgrims.
According to legend the cave is situated at the place where Lord Shiva had given

amrit (nectar) to the gods of the Hindu. It is believed that Lord Shiva adopted the shape of an 
ice-lingam which still exists in the cave.
The Yatra was abandoned for a long time due to devastating floods and other natural calamities in 
the
valley. A local Muslim family called Maliks is said to have re-discovered it. The successive 
generations of

the Malik family of Mattan have since then been taking an active part in preparation of the Yatra 
and they

get a share of the offerings at the cave.

The Kashmiri labourers, invariably all Muslims, help the pilgrims throughout. The pilgrims traverse 
the route
chanting "Har Har Mahadev" and "Amarnath Swami Ki Jai". The Muslim helpers join them by saying "Ya

Peer Dastgeer". The Yatra culimates on the full moon day of August.

Hajj

Nearly 3 million Muslims from more than 120 countries journey to the holy

city of Makkah each year to make the spiritual pilgrimage known as the Hajj. The pilgrimage is one 
of five Pillars of Islam that form the framework of Islamic life.
Muslims trace the origin of the Haj to Prophet Ibrahim, who rebuilt the first


   
   


 

House of Allah, the 7 'aza, as the focal point for the worship of Allah alone.

The Hajj begins on the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic year, and lasts for
six days,

from 8th-12th of Dhul-Hijjah. For the first three days of the Haj, the pilgrims are required to 
wear special

garments called /Eazzz

Upon arrival in Makkah, the pilgrims go to the 7¥tzazzz  are/ (Holy mosque) and perform the 
7*ai4eaf or
the circumambulation around the Kaaba or the House of Allah.

The rituals also involve stoning (Rami) of the Max <a/ (Satan) on the 1Qh of Dhul-Hijjah, followed 
by the
performance of Tanah- e•W apart and & w at Makkah, which marks the culmination of the main rituals 
of
the Hajj.

In India, the Ministry of External Affairs is the nodal agency which is responsible for making 
arrangements
for the Indians Hajjis. Nearly 1,72,000 Indian pilgrims are going every year to perform Hajj. In 
addition, nearly 80,000 Indian pilgrims visit Saudi Arabia every year to perform the lesser 
pilgrimage known as


Kumbh Mela
Kumbh Mela is the greatest riverside religious festival of Hindus that takes place once every three 
years. However, the major Maha Kumbh Mela occurs once in

12 years.

Legend has it that Lord Vishnu saved the nectar (Amrut) from the demons and gave it to the gods in 
a pot. The gods rested the pot at each of the four cities of Allahabad, Haridwar, Ujjain, and 
Nasik.
A few drops of Nectar are supposed to have spilled over on the water at these four places and 
sages,
saints and pilgrims started periodically to flock to each of these 'Tirthas' to celebrate the 
divine event.


   
   


 

Thousands of devotees take a holy dip in the river that is believed to purge them of their sin.

Recorded history is witness to the fact that the Kumbh festival has been celebrated since even 
before the
second century BC. Ayyappa Temple
The hill temple of Lord Awappa in Shabarimala is situated in the Western Ghats of Kerala.
The temple is open to all devotees irrespective of caste, creed, religion or social

status. It attracts millions of pilgrims from within and outside India every year. Lord Ayyappa is 
also described as Hariharaputra, the son of Vishnu and Shiva, born in a supernatural way to 
annihilate the demoness Mahishi.
The idol of Ayyappa is believed to have been installed at Sabrimala on the day of Makar Sankranti 
(mid-
January). Devotees believe that on this day, a peculiar light called ‘Ahara Id'/a z/ or d aza- 
z¥‘r' is
seen facing the deity over the hills and they eagerly await this blissful sight.

The Makara Vilakku is preceded by the period of dzz¥t/azz7which is a 41-day long ritualistic
worship

during which the pilgrims observe strict discipline and rigid austerities like wearing black 
clothes, observing

strict celibacy and avoiding meat and alcohol.

Girls and women between 10 and 50 years of age are not allowed to visit the temple to facilitate 
strict
observance of celibacy in the temple complex.

Only those pilgrims who have observed the austerities for at least 41 days are allowed to use the 
73z/?zerY/‘azp¥zc (or the 18 steps) leading to the main sanctum sanctorum.
The devotees greet one another as  Aezipe &<azzzxzz  a  .

Pushkar Mela


   
   


 
The Pushkar Fair is held in the month of Kartik on the full moon day in Pushkar. Pushkar is home to 
one of the only two temples dedicated to Brahma, the other being at
Khedbrahma in

Kerala. It is one of the innumerable temples skirting the large Pushkar Lake.

The Pushkar fair centres around the event of taking a dip in the Pushkar Lake on the full moon 
night. Due
to its association with Brahma, Pushkar is considered to be the z’r</ zr a, the king of all 
pilgrimage sites.

The nearby temple of Savitri also attracts many married women, especially from Bengal, who
worship the

goddess and seek the boon of eternal company with their spouse.

Pushkar is also the site for the biggest cattle fair in India. Scholars suggest that the cattle 
fair was an extension of the religious event of taking a dip in the lake.
Urs of Khwaja Moin-Ud-Din Chishti

Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, the founder of the Chishti order, came to India from

Persia as a member of Muhammad Gouri's invading army in 1191. He settled in Ajmer, where he 
preached Islam until his death in 1233 AD. A darga was built in his memory. Affectionately called 
zBz/6 7Ié'uz, he was said to be an emancipator of the poor.
Each year an Urs is celebrated is celebrated in the month of Rajab to commemorate the death 
anniversary

of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti. According to the legend, the Khwaja entered his cell on the first day 
of the

month of Rajab to meditate for five days and died on the sixth day.

During this six-day fair, which is attended by people of different communities, various ceremonies 
are
performed and the Qawwalis are sung in praise of the Khwaja.

The tomb is known for its power to fulfill wishes. Devotees tie a la/acs on the pillars when 
seeking
a

favour. They are expected to untie the knot once their request has been granted.

   
   


 

3. National Symbols of India

13. National Flag

The National flag is a horizontal tri-colour of deep saffron (kesari) at the top, white in

the middle and dark green at the bottom in equal proportion. The saffron stands for courage, 
sacrifice and the spirit of renunciation; the white stands for purity and truth and the green for 
faith and fertility.
The ratio of width of the flag to its length is two to three. In the centre of the white

band is a navy blue wheel which has 24 spokes. Its diameter approximates the width of the white 
band. Its

design is taken from that of the wheel which appears on the abacus of the Lion Capital of Ashoka at 
Sarnath.
The design of the national flag was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 22 July 1947.

The Flag Code of India, 2002, has taken effect from 26 January 2002 and supercedes the ‘Flag Code - 
as
it existed. The Flag Code of India, 2002 is an attempt to bring together all such laws, 
conventions, practices

and instructions for the guidance and benefit of all concerned.

There shall be no restriction on the display of the National Flag by members of general public, 
private
organisations, educational institutions, etc., except to the extent provided in the Emblems and 
Names

(Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 
and any

other law enacted on the subject.

14. State Emblem

The state emblem depicts four lions, standing back to back. It is an adaptation from the Sarnath

Lion Capital of Ashoka, near Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. Carved out of a single block of polished 
sandstone, the capital is crowned by the Wheel of the Law (Dharma Chakra).
The Lion Capital was erected in the third century BC by Emperor Ashoka to mark the spot where 
Buddha first proclaimed his gospel of peace and emancipation to the four quarters of the
   
   


 

universe.

In the State emblem, adopted by the Government of India on 26 January 1950, only three lions are 
visible, the fourth being hidden from view.
The four lions symbolizing power, courage and confidence, rest on a circular abacus. The abacus is 
girdled
by four smaller animals -- guardians of the four directions: the lion of the north, the elephant of 
the east, the

horse of the south and the bull of the west. The abacus rests on a lotus in full bloom, 
exemplifying the fountainhead of life and creative inspiration.
The words Satyameva Jayate (meaning 'truth alone tirumphs’) from Mundaka Upanishad are inscribed
below the abacus in Devanagari script.

The use of the state emblem of India, as the official seal of the Government of India, is regulated 
by the
state of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005.

15. National Anthem

The song Jana-gana-mana, composed originally in Bengali by Rabindranath

Tagore, was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly as the national anthem of 
India on Tuesday, 24 January f950.
Rabindranath Tagore wrote it at the request of his intimate friend Ashutosh

Chaudhari, a judge of the Calcutta High Court, for singing at the 26th session of the Indian 
National Congress on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta Session of the Indian National Congress.
Playing time of the full version of the National Anthem is approximately 52

seconds. A short version consisting of the first and last lines of the stanza (playing time 
approximately 20 seconds) is also played on certain occasions.
16. National Song



his
The song Vande Mataram, composed in Sanskrit by Bankimchandra Chatterji, was incorporated in


   
   


 

famous novel Ananda Math (1882). It has an equal status with the National Anthem.

Later the song was set to tune by Rabindranath Tagore and sung for the first time before the 
gathering at
the 12th annual session of the Indian National Congress held in 1896 in Calcutta.
It was declared as the National Song in 1937 through a resolution. The English translation of the 
stanza was rendered by Sri Aurobindo.

17. National Calendar

The National Calendar is based on the Saka Era with Chaitra being its first month.
It consists of 365 days in a normal year. It was adopted from

22nd March 1957 along with the Gregorian calendar for the following official purposes: Gazette of 
India; news broadcast by All India Radio; calendars issued by Government of India; and, Government 
communications addressed to the members of the public.
Dates of the National Calendar correspond with those of the

Greogrian Calendar. Thus, the first day of Chaitra corresponds to 22nd March in a normal year and 
21 March in leap year.
18. National Animal

The Tiger - Panthera tigris (linnaeus), is the national animal of India. It is a rich-colored

well-striped animal with a short coat. The combination of grace, strength, power has earned the 
tiger great respect and high esteem.
Out of eight races of the species known, the Indian race, the Royal Bengal Tiger, is

found throughout the country except in the north-western region and also in the neighbouring 
countries, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.
19. National Bird


   
   


 
The Indian peacock, Pavo cristatus, the national bird of India, is a colourful, swansized bird, 
with a fan-shaped crest of feathers, a white patch under the eye and a

long, slender neck.

The male of the species is more colourful than the female, with a glistening blue breast and neck 
and a spectacular bronze-green trail of around 200 elongated feathers. The female is brownish, 
slightly smaller than the male and lacks the trail.
The elaborate courtship dance of the male, fanning out the tail and preening its feathers is a 
gorgeous
sight.

20. National Flower

Lotus or waterlily is an acquatic plant of Nymphaea with broad flaoting leaves and bright fragrant 
flowers that grow only in shallow waters.
It is a sacred flower and occupies a unique position in the art and mythology of ancient

India and has been an auspicious symbol of Indian culture since time immemorial.

21. National Fruit

Mango (Manigifera indica) is the National fruit of India. Mango is one of the most widely

grown fruits of the tropical countries. In India, mango is cultivated almost in all parts, with the 
exception of hilly areas.
Mango is a rich source of Vitamins A, C and D.

Mangoes have been cultivated in India from time immemorial. The poet Kalidasa sang of its

praises. Alexander savoured its taste, as did the Chinese pilgrim Hieun Tsang. Akbar planted 
100,000 mango trees in Darbhanga, known as Lakhi Bagh.
22. National Tree

The Banyan Tree (Ficus benghalensis) is the National Tree of India.

This huge tree towers over its neighbours and has the widest reaching roots of all known trees, 
easily covering several acres. It sends off new shoots from its roots, so that one tree is really a 
tangle of branches, roots, and trunks.
   
   


 

23. National aquatic animal

The Gangetic Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) is the National aquatic animal of India. The Ganges 
river dolphin is primarily found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers.
Gangatic Dolphin is said to represent the purity of the holy Ganga as it can only survive in pure 
and fresh water.
It is listed by the IUCN as endangered on their Red List of Threatened Species.

24. National Currency Symbol

The symbol is an amalgam of Devanagari "Ra" and the Roman Capital "R" with two parallel horizontal 
stripes running at the top representing the national flag and also the "equal to" sign.
The Indian Rupee sign was adopted by the Government of India on 15th July, 2010.

The symbol of Indian Rupee signifies India's international identity for money transactions and 
economic strength.
The symbol, conceptualised and designed by Udaya Kumar, a post graduate in Design from Indian 
Institute
of Technology Bombay, has been chosen from thousands of concept entries received by the Ministry of

Finance through an open competition among resident Indian nationals.

25. National Heritage animal

The Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) has been declared as the national heritage animal by 
the
government in order to conserve its dwindling population.

60% of the Asian elephants live in India. There are over 25,000 elephants in the

country, including 3,500 in captivity in zoos and temples - particularly in southern and 
north-eastern parts of the country.
Indian Elephant has been listed as endangered by IUCN as the population has

declined by at least 50% over the last three generations

26. National game


   
   


 

The Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports of India clarified that, officially, the country does not 
have a national
game, no game, including hockey, has been notified as such.

However, many sources, including the Indian government's official portal, mention hockey as a 
"National
Game".

India has won eight Olympic gold medals for hockey. Indian hockey's golden period was from 1928—56,
when the Indian hockey team won six successive Olympic gold medals.

4. Languages

In India there are 22 scheduled languages, 114 other languages, 216 mother tongues, 96 non 
specified languages

and totally up to 10000 languages spoken by the people.

Classification

Indian languages have evolved from different stocks and are closely associated with the different 
ethnic groups of

India. Broadly the Indian languages can be put into six groups: 1) Indo-Aryan, 2) Dravidian, 3) 
Sino- Tibetan, 4)

Negroid, S) Austric and 6) Others. These languages have interacted on one another through the 
centuries and

have produced the major linguistic divisions of modern India. The Indo-Aryan and the Dravidian are
the dominant

groups and together comprises all the major languages of India.

1. Indo-Aryan:

It is part of the Indo-European family of languages, which came to India with the Aryans.

It is the biggest of the language groups in India and accounts for about 74% of the total Indian 
population.

It comprises of all the principal languages of northern and western India such as Hindi, Bengali,
Marathi,
Gujarati, Punjabi, Sindhi, Rajasthani, Assamese, Oriya, Pahari, Bihari, Kashmiri, Urdu and 
Sanskrit.

2. Dravidian:


   
   


 

This is the second most important group and comprises mainly of languages spoken in the Southern 
India.
It covers about 25% of the Indian population.

Proto-Dravidian gave rise to 21 Dravidian Languages. They can be broadly classified into three 
groups:
Northern group, Central group, and Southern group of Dravidian languages.

The 7Kzr/'zzz   consists of three languages i.e. Brahui, Malto and Kudukh. Brahui is spoken
in

Baluchistan, Malto spoken in Bengal and Orissa, while Kurukh is spoken in Bengal, Orissa, Bihar and 
Madhya Pradesh.
The C rYza/  zxrp consists of eleven languages viz., Gondi, Khond, Kui, Manda, Parji, Gadaba, 
Kolami,
Pengo, Naiki, Kuvi and Telugu. Out of these, only Telugu became a civilized language and the rest 
remained tribal languages.
The scxa’ zzz ¿;  consists of seven languages viz., Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Tulu, Kodagu,
Toda

and Kota.

The major languages of the Dravidian group are: (i) Telugu (numerically the biggest of the 
Dravidian
languages), (ii) Tamil (oldest and purest language of the Dravidian family), (iii) Kannada and (iv)
Malayalam

(smallest and the youngest of the Dravidian family).




3. Sino-Tibetan:

The Sino-Tibetan or Mongoloid family stretches all over the sub-Himalayan tracts, covering North 
Bihar,
North Bengal, Assam up to the north-eastern frontiers of the country.

These languages are considered to be older than the Indo-Aryan languages and are referred to in the


   
   


 

oldest Sanskrit literature as S<a/as.

The Tibeto-Burman languages are divided into four broad groups:

{/} 77'  zz. Sikkimese, Bhotia, Balti, Sherpa, Lahuli and Ladakhi

{/z“} Hsia/ayan.- Kanauri and Limbu

{/'i“/} 7IAr/ z•  azzr Abor (Adi), Miri, Aka, Dafla and Mishmi

/? xg Maznloziese.- It is again sub-divided into four main sub-groups, viz. Kuki-Chin, Mikir, Bodo 
and Naga. Manipuri or Meithi is the most important language of the Kuki-Chin sub-group. The Bodo 
sub-group includes such dialects as Bodo, Rajbangsi, Koch, Mech, Rabha, Dimasa, Kachari, Chutiya, 
Garo, Haijong and the Tipra (Tirupuri). Mikir has strong affinities to the Bodo and is spoken in 
the Mikir Hills and Parts of Sibsagar district in Assam. The principal languages of the Naga 
sub-group are Angami, Sema, Ao, Lotha, Mao, Konyak, Kabui and Lepcha.
4. Austric:

The Austric languages of India belong to the Austro-Asiatic sub-family, which are represented by

languages of the Munda or Kol Group, spoken in the central, eastern and north-eastern India and 
languages of the Mon-Khmer group like Khasi and Nicobarese.
These are very ancient languages which have been in existence much before the advent of Aryans and
were referred in ancient Sanskrit literature as 7I/saz¥zs.

The most important language of the Austric group is &z ' e//, which is spoken by over 5 million 
Santhals
and is the largest spoken among the Adivasi languages.

drx¥zz?, spoken by about a million Mundas, is another important language of this group.

5. Others:

This group incudes several Dravidian adivasi languages like Gondi, Oraon or Kurukh, MaI-
Pahariya, Khond

and Parji which are very distinct and cannot be classified in other groups. Pali and Prakrit


   
   


 

Pali and Prakrit are the languages that belong to the Middle Indo-Aryan period i.e. 600 BC-1000 AD.
Prakrit was

the Indo-Aryan speech which was in the form of uncultivated popular dialects. Prakrit came down to 
us in

inscriptions dating back to 4-3 BC. Practically all over India, Prakrits were freely used for 
inscriptions almost up to

the Gupta age.

In the course of time, the Prakrits were transformed into what are known as the  Zz razzsa 
dialects, which were

widely used in popular and folk literature. The various Prakrit dialects described by Prakrit 
grammarians are

Maharastri, Sauraseni, Magadhi, Paisaci and Apabhramsa. Pali and Ardha-Magadhi are also Prakrits 
and were

used in early Buddhist and Jain literature. The Satavahana rulers were great patrons of Prakrit.

The earliest of the Buddhist literature is in Pali. Some consider Pali as Magadhi Prakrit or 
Magadhi- bhasa, while

others point to a close relationship of Pali with Paisaci Prakrit spoken at that time in the 
Vindhya region. The

Tripitakas; Milindapanha; Petakopadesa and Visuddhimagga are some early works in Pali.

There is no consensus for a specific time where the modern north Indian languages such as 
Hindustani,

Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Sindhi and Oriya emerged, but AD 1000 is
commonly

accepted.

The Dravidian languages of South India had a history independent of Sanskrit. Though Malayalam and 
Telugu are

Dravidian in origin, over eighty percent of their lexicon is borrowed from Sanskrit. The Kannada 
and Tamil

languages have lesser Sanskrit and Prakrit influence. The Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman languages 
of North-

East India also have long independent histories.

Official Languages

English was the only language used for official purpose in the British India. In the independent 
India, it was



   
   


 

declared in Article 343 (1) that Hindi will be the official Union language. It was also mentioned 
that over a period of

fifteen years since the commencement of the Indian Constitution, Hindi will replace English as the 
official language.

However, the Parliament can decide whether to use English as an official language or not.

The non-Hindi speaking communities across the country protested on the aspect of the change in 
official language
from English to Hindi. This protest resulted in the enactment of the Official Language Act, 1963.
According to the

act, Hindi in Devanagari script has been declared the official language of the Union. However, 
English may also be

used for official purposes even after 1965. English has been given the status of the ’szrzzsrz az


of India. It was decided that either Hindi or English can be used for procedures of Parliament. It 
should be noted that there is no national language of India. Hindi is not a national language. 
Neither the Constitution of India, nor any Indian law defines any national language.
In the Constitution of India, there is a provision made for each of the Indian states to choose 
their own official

language for communicating at the state level. The selected languages, which can be used for 
official purpose,

have been listed in the &j;dd/z A7 nsfr/e to the Constitution. At present there are 22 languages in 
the Eighth

schedule. Initially there were 14 languages. The Z7’z c  /?/zd’?cz'e/ az/ezx /ezz’ ac:Y' {/992}
provided for the

inclusion of &  , / x ad, W?/er/o7 aA7¥jce/?. The 17a QrzsYr/za’?crzz/ az/ezxézezx‘ act
{26U3}, added 4

more languages — Zbofg W?/ /?,   ?, at dz 'a/?. The 22 official languages are:
1. ASSAMESE - Assam

2. BENGALI - Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Tripura, West Bengal

3. BODO - Assam

4. DOGRI - Jammu and Kashmir

5. GUJARATI - Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Gujarat

   
   


 

6. HINDI - Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, the 
national

capital territory of Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar 
Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
7. KANNADA - Karnataka

8. KASHMIRI - Jammu and Kashmir

9. KONKAN I - Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra

10. MAITHILI - Bihar

11. MALAYALAM - Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Kerala

12. MANIPURI (also MEITEI or MEITHEI) - Manipur

13. MARATHI - Dadra & Nagar Haveli , Daman and Diu, Goa, Maharashtra

14. NEPALI - Sikkim, West Bengal

15. ODIYA - Odisha

16. PUNJABI - Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab

17. SANSKRIT — Only in scriptures. Not in usage.

18. SANTHALI - Santhal tribals of the Chota Nagpur Plateau (comprising the states of Bihar, 
Chattisgarh,

Jharkhand, Orissa)

19. SINDHI - Sindhi community

20. TAMIL - Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu.

21. TELUGU - Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh

22. URDU - Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh

However the constitution does not specify the official languages to be used by the states for the 
conduct of their
official functions, and leaves each state free to adopt any language used in its territory as its 
official language or

languages. 7 e /azgc j;e ze¥ad'zzz/‘ Ze  c¥° liaise /rs/ed'?zz /W &j;dz/' z the, and several states 
have

adopted official languages which are not so listed. Examples include Kokborok in Tripura, Mizo in 
Mizoram, Khasi,

Garo, and Jaintia in Meghalaya, and French in Puducherry.


   
   


 

Classical language status

In 2004, the Government of India declared that languages that met certain requirements could be 
accorded the

status of a "Classical Language in India".

The following criteria were laid down to determine the eligibility of languages to be considered 
for classification as a

"Classical Language":

High antiquity of its early texts/recorded history over a period of 1500-2000 years

A body of ancient literature/texts, which is considered a valuable heritage by generations of 
speakers

The literary tradition be original and not borrowed from another speech community
The classical language and literature being distinct from modern, there may also be a discontinuity 
between the classical language and its later forms or its offshoots.

Tamil became the first language in India to attain the status of classical language in 2004. In 
2005,
Sanskrit, which

already had special status in Article 351 of the Constitution of India as the primary source 
language for the

development of the official standard of Hindi, was also declared to be a classical language. 
Kannada and Telugu

were accorded the status in 2008, based on the recommendation of a committee of linguistic experts 
constituted by

the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.

5. Architecture

27. Indus Valley Civilization

The Indus civilization flourished during the Bronze Age i.e. 2500-2000 BC. Extensive excavation 
work has so far

identified more than 100 sites belonging to this civilization. Some of the important sites are 
Dholavira (Gujarat),

Kalibangan (Rajasthan), Lothal (Gujarat), Sarkotada (Gujarat), Diamabad (Maharashtra), Alamgirpur 
(U.P.),

Bhagwanpura (Haryana), Banawali (Haryana), Kuntasi, Padri (Gujarat) and Mauda (Jammu). The first of 
its cities to


   
   


 

be unearthed was located at Harappa, excavated in the 1920s in the Punjab province of British India 
(now in

Pakistan).

Characteristic features

The Indus Valley is one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, along with its contemporaries, 
Mesopotamia and

Ancient Egypt. At its peak, the Indus Civilization may have had a population of well over five 
million.
Extensive ice+'z /'a  Mgr was the characteristic of this civilization, which is

evident from the gridiron pattern for the layout of cities, some with fortifications and the 
elaborate drainage and water management systems.
The grid layout planning of the cities with xczzzdz a/ erac/ zrj;dd azg;d'es is a modern system 
that was implemented in the cities of this particular civilization.
The houses were built of Ze4ed'&rc4s. Bricks of fixed sizes, as well as stone and wood were also 
used for building.
Buildings in the lower area are rather monotonous, being mainly functional rather than decorative.

The most imposing of the buildings is the zzea/ Zb/ z c¥°  e a zoo It is 54.86 metres long and 
32.91
metres wide and with 2.43 metres thick outer walls. The Bath had galleries and rooms on all sides.

Another important structure was the &azzzz cogs¥'ew comprising of blocks with an overall area of 55 
x 43
metres. The granaries were intelligently constructed, with strategic air ducts and platforms 
divided into units.
28. The Mauryan Period

Other than the remnants of Indus valley civilization, the earliest surviving architectural heritage 
in India is that of the

Mauryans.

Initial period

Some of the monuments and pillars belonging to this period are considered as the finest specimens 
of Indian art.

   
   


 

The Mauryan architecture was embalmed in timber, for rocks and stones were not as freely in use 
then. The art of

polishing of wood reached so much perfection during the Mauryan period that master craftsmen used 
to make

wood glisten like a mirror.

In 300 B.C., Chandragupta Maurya constructed a «onsg'zz let  14.48 km long and 2.41km wide, along 
the Ganges
in Bihar. However, only a couple of teak beams have survived from this fort.

Ashoka

Ashoka was the first Mauryan Emperor who began the six  axc@/ec/zzze. The stonework of the Ashokan 
Period

(3rd century B.C.) was of a highly diversified order and comprised of lofty free-standing pillars, 
railings of the

stupas, lion thrones and other colossal figures. While most of the shapes and decorative forms 
employed were

indigenous in origin, some exotic forms show the influence of Greek, Persian and Egyptian cultures.

The Ashokan period marked the beginning of the Buddhist School of architecture in India. It 
witnessed the

construction of many rock-cut caves, pillars, stupas and palaces. A number of cave-shrines 
belonging to this period

have been excavated in the Zb<aZzzr and 7lég¥zyzzl  //s and  /’azo'<  in Bihar. The caves are are 
simple in plan
and are devoid of all interior decorative carvings. They served as the residences of the monks.

There are several inscriptions, which indicate that these rock-cut sanctuaries were constructed by 
Emperor

Ashoka for the monks of the @?v?4a sect, who are more closely related to the Jains than to the 
Buddhists.

The Ashokan rock-edict at Z7 zzd/, near Bhubaneshwar, is considered to be the earliest rock-cut 
sculpture in India.
It has a sculpied elephant on the top, which signifies the Emperor's conversion to Buddhism after 
his Kalinga

VlCtOF'/.

Ashokan Pillars

The monolithic Ashokan pillars are marvels of architecture and sculpture. These were lofty free

   
   


 

standing monolithic columns erected on sacred sites. Each pillar was about 15.24 metres high and

weighed about 50 tonnes and was made out of fine sandstone. They carried declarations from the king

regarding Buddhism or any other topic. The pillars have four component parts.

(i) 7Zr' s7z'z/is are always plain and smooth, circular in cross-section, slightly tapering upwards 
and always chiselled out of a single piece of stone.
(ii) 7 e cap:r'/’a/s have the shape and appearance of a gently arched bell formed of lotus petals.

(iii) Zoe aza r are of two types: square and plain and circular and decorated and these are of 
different proportions.
(iv) 7Zr' c<  Mgr azr'x is are either seated or standing, always in the round and chiseled as a 
single piece
with the abaci.

The &zzzz/A @/law is one of the finest pieces of sculpture of the Ashokan period erected in 250 BC.
Here, four lions

are seated back to back. The four lions symbolize power, courage, confidence and pride. This Lion
Capital of

Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the National Emblem of India and the wheel "Ashoka Chakra" 
from its

base was placed onto the centre of the National Flag of India. At present the Column remains in the 
same place

where as Lion Capital is at the Sarnath Museum. The Stupas
Stupa is a mound-like structure containing Buddhist relics, typically the ashes of deceased, used 
by Buddhists as a

place of meditation. Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several stupas, which were 
large halls, capped

with domes and bore symbols of the Buddha. The most important ones are located at Bharhut, 
Bodhgaya, Sanchi,

Amravati and Nagarjunakonda.

Built for a variety of reasons, Buddhist stupas are classified based on form and function into five 
types:

1. 7Z'/re &zz/zz - in which the relics or remains of the Buddha, his disciples and lay saints are 
interred.

   
   


 

2. Object stupa - in which the items interred are objects belonged to the Buddha or his disciples 
such as a

begging bowl or robe, or important Buddhist scriptures.

3. z2zmwz/ora// ze s/’zr  - built to commemorate events in the lives of Buddha or his disciples.

4. @  ie s/zz,oa - to symbolise aspects of Buddhist theology, for example, Borobuddur is considered 
to be
the symbol of "the Three Worlds (dhatu) and the spiritual stages (bhumi) in a Mahayana 
bodhisattva's character."
5. I ¥‘?ze s/zz  - constructed to commemorate visits or to gain spiritual benefits, usually at the 
site of
prominent stupas which are regularly visited.

The shape of the stupar  esez 's /7'e   , crowned and sitting in meditation posture on a lion 
throne. His crown is the top of the spire; his head is the square at the spire's base; his body is 
the vase shape; his legs are the four steps of the lower terrace; and the base is his throne. The 
stupa represent the five purified elements:
The square base represents earth

The hemispherical dome/vase represents water The conical spire represents fire
The upper lotus parasol and the crescent moon represents air The sun and the dissolving point 
represents the element of space


Apart from the than ruins of stupa at Piprahwa (Nepal), the core of stupa No 1 at Sanchi can be 
considered
as the oldest of the stupas.

Originally built by Asoka, it was enlarged in subsequent centuries. An inscription by the ivory 
carvers of
Vidisha on the southern gateway throws light on the transference of building material from 
perishable
wood
and ivory to the more durable stone.

   
   


 


Amaravati stupa, built in 2nd or 1st century BC was probably like the one at Sanchi, but in later 
centuries it
was transformed from a Hinayana shrine to a Mahayana shrine.

Amaravati stupa is different from the Bharhut and Sanchi stupas. It had free-standing columns 
surmounted
by lions near the gateways. The dome was covered with sculptured panels.

The stupa had an upper circumambulatory path on the drum as at Sanchi. This path had two 
intricately
carved railings. The stone is greenish-white limestone of the region.



The Bharhut stupa may have been established by the Maurya king Asoka in the 3rd century BCE, but
many works of art were apparently added during the Sunga period, with many friezes from the 2nd 
century

BCE.

The stupa (now dismantled and reassembled at Kolkata Museum) contains numerous birth stories of the
Buddha's previous lives, or Jataka tales.



The Gandhara stupa is a further development of stupas at Sanchi and Bharhut.

In Gandhara stupas the base, dome and the hemisphere dome are sculpted. The stupa tapers
upward to

form a tower like structure.

The stupas of Nagarjunakonda in Krishna valley were very large. At the base there were brick walls
forming wheel and spokes, which were filled with earth. The Maha Chaitya of Nagarjunakonda has a 
base

in the form of Swastika, which is a sun symbol.



   
   


 

29. The Sungas, Kushans and Satavahanas

After the death of Ashoka Mauryan dynasty came to an end and the Sungas and Kushans ruled in the 
north and

the Satavahanas in the south. These dynasties made advances in art and architecture in areas like 
stone

construction, stone carving, symbolism and beginning of temple (or c/zzr/’ a /zz//) and the 
monastery (or v/Sena)

constructions.

The period between 2nd century B.C. and 3rd century A.D. marked the beginning of the sculptural 
idiom in Indian

sculpture where the elements of physical form were evolving into a more refined, realistic and 
expressive style.

Under these dynasties the Asokan stupas were enlarged and the earlier brick and wood works were
replaced with stone-works. The Sanchi Stupa was enlarged to nearly twice its size in 150 B.C. and

elaborate gateways were added later. The Sungas reconstructed the railings around the Barhut Stupa 
and

built the toranas or the gateways.

The Satavahanas constructed a large number of stupas at Goli, Jaggiahpeta, Bhattiprolu, Gantasala,
Nagarjunakonda and Amravati.

During the Kushan period, the Z o£ e  ze esem'ed’?zz zzzszr /mzrzinstead of symbols.
Buddha's

image in endless forms and replicas became the principal element in Buddhist sculpture during the 
Kushan

period.

The Kushans were the pioneers of the Gandhara School of Art and a large number of monasteries;
stupas

and statues were constructed during the reign of Kanishka.

30. The Schools of Art

The Gandhara School of Art (50 B.C. to 500 A.D.)

The Gadhara region extending from Punjab to the borders of Afghanistan was an important centre of
Mahayana

   
   


 

Buddhism up to the Sth century A.D. The region became famous throughout the world since a new 
school of Indian

sculpture known as the Gandhara School developed during that period. Owing to its strategic 
location the

Gandhara School imbibed all kinds of foreign influences like Persian, Greek, Roman, Saka and 
Kushan.

The Gandhara School of Art is also known as the taeco-bsl W << ' of Art since Greek techniques of 
Art were applied to Buddhist subjects. The most important contribution of the Gandhara School of 
Art was the evolution of beautiful images of the Buddha and Bodhisattavas, which were executed in 
black stone and modelled on identical characters of Graeco-Roman pantheon. Hence it is said, "the 
Gandhara artist had the hand of a Greek but the heart of an Indian."
The important characteristics of Gandhara school are: Depiction of Lord Buddha in the standing or 
seated positions.
The seated Buddha is always shown cross-legged in the traditional Indian way.
Rich carving, elaborate ornamentation and complex symbolism.

Use of key sz'cz e

The best specimens of Gandhara art are from Jazz/?  and Z7ezz/sz rna stupa at Taxila and from 7gtz 
:8 near

Jalalabad in modern Afghanistan. The tallest rock-cut statue of Lord Buddha is also located at Zbx 
' zt in modern

Afghanistan.

The Mathura School of Art

The Mathura School of art flourished at the city of Mathura between 1-3 A.D. and was promoted by 
the Kushans. It established the tradition of transforming Buddhist symbols into human form. The 
important characteristics of Mathura school are:
The earliest sculptures of Buddha were made keeping the Matsya  64'64' ,oz in mind. They were 
depicted as strongly built with the right hand raised in protection and the left
   
   


 

hand on the waist.

The figures produced by this school of art do not have moustaches and beards as in the Gandhara 
Art.
fled 7d / sama:/ sieve mainly used.

Here along with the Buddha, the kings, royal family were included in the architecture.
It not only produced beautiful images of the Buddha but also of the Jain Tirthankaras

and gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon.

The Guptas adopted the Mathura School of Art and further improvised and perfected it.

The Amravati School of Art

The Amravati school of Art evolved during Satavahna period. This school of art developed at 
Amravati, on the banks of the Krishna River in modern Andhra Pradesh. It is the site for the 
largest Buddhist stupa of South India. The stupendous stupa could not withstand the ravages of time 
and its ruins are preserved in the London Museum. This school of art had great influence on art in 
Sri Lanka and South-East Asia as products from here were carried to those countries.
Characteristic features of Amravati school are:

In the initial periods, Lord Buddha is depicted in the form of ”Swastika” mark. This has been 
carved out on
the cushioned seat over a throne that is situated under the Bodhi tree.

At a later stage the Amaravati School depicted Buddha in the human form.

The figures of Amaravati have slim blithe features and are represented in difficult poses and 
curves.
However the scenes are over-crowded



The images of Lord Buddha from Alluru, Dharma Chakra from Lingaraja Palli, Bodhisattvas are some of 
the finest

instances of the Amaravati School of art and sculpture.

   
   


 

31. Gupta period

Gupta period witnessed a great development in the field of architecture. The earlier schools of art 
continued in this

period as well. In addition a new school of art was developed, called Saranath school. The 
characteristic features of

this school are:

Usage of cream coloured sand stone Nakedness was missing, more sobre More refined and decorative 
background
Hallow effect

The standing figure of abundantly ornamented Tara is one of the best specimens of sculptural art of 
Sarnath

School.

Building of new stupas and enlargement of old ones continued in this period. Dhamekh stupa near 
Saranath is an

example.

Development of Temple architecture is one of the greatest achievements of Guptas. The temples of 
the Gupta

period brought the new concept of installing statues of Gods in temples, a practice that did not 
take place earlier.

There was also move towards the use of stone in construction instead of the earlier brick or wood.

32. Temple architecture
Parts of a temple complex

Jagati - raised surface, platform or terrace upon which the temple is placed.
Mandapa/mantapa - pillared outdoor hall or pavilion for public rituals.
Antarala - a small antichamber or foyer between the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) and the 
mandapa,
   
   


 

more typical of north Indian temples.

Ardha Mandapa - intermediary space between the

temple exterior and the garba griha (sanctum sanctorum) or the other mandapas of the temple
Asthana Mandapa - assembly hall

Kalyana Mandapa - dedicated to ritual marriage celebration of the Lord with Goddess
Maha Mandapa - When there are several mandapas in the temple, it is the biggest and the tallest.
It is

used for conducting religious discourses.

Garbhagriha - the part in which the idol of the deity in a Hindu temple is installed i.e.Sanctum 
sanctorum.
The area around is referred as to the Chuttapalam, which generally includes other deities and the 
main

boundary wall of the temple. Typically there is also a Pradikshna area inside the Grbhagriha and 
one outside, where devotees can take Pradakshinas.
Sikhara or Vimana - literally means "mountain peak", refer to the rising tower over the sanctum 
sanctorum
where the presiding deity is enshrined is the most prominent and visible part of a Hindu temples.

Amalaka - a stone disk, usually with ridges on the rim, that sits atop a temple's main tower 
(Sikhara).

Gopuram - the elaborate gateway-towers of south Indian temples, not to be confused with Shikharas.

Urushringa - An urushringa is a subsidiary Sikhara, lower and narrower, tied against the main 
sikhara.
They draw the eye up to the highest point, like a series of hills leading to a distant peak.

At the turn of the first millennium CE two major types of temples existed, the northern or Nagara 
style and the

southern or Dravida type of temple. They are distinguishable mainly by the shape and decoration of 
their shikhara.

   
   


 

Nagara style: The shikhar is beehive/curvilinear shaped.

Dravida style: The shikhar consists of progressively smaller storeys of pavilions.

A third style termed Vesara was once common in Karnataka which combined the two styles. This may be 
seen in

the classic Hindu temples of India and Southeast Asia, such as Angkor Wat, Brihadisvara, Khajuraho, 
Mukteshvara, and Prambanan.





Nagara School

Nagara temples have two distinct features:

(i) In plan, the temple is a square with a number of graduated projections in the middle of each 
side giving a

cruciform shape with a number of re-entrant angles on each side.

(ii) In elevation, a Sikhara, i.e., tower gradually inclines inwards in a convex curve.

The projections in the plan are also carried upwards to the top of the Sikhara and, thus, there is 
strong emphasis on vertical lines in elevation.
The Nagara style is widely distributed over a greater part of India, exhibiting distinct varieties 
and ramifications in lines of evolution and elaboration according to each locality. Examples of 
Nagara architecture are:
(a) Odisha school: 8th tO 13t century
Lingaraj temple in Bubaneshwar

Sun temple of Kornak (climax of Nagar style)

(b) Chandela school:
Kandaria Mahadev temple, Kajuraho Typical nature is Erotism

(c) Gujarat under solankis

   
   


 
Modhera sun temple Rajasthna dilwara jain temple

Dravida schools

Dravidian style temples consist almost invariably of the four following parts, differing only 
according to the age in

which they were executed:

(i) The principal part, the temple itself, is called the Vimana. It is always square in plan and 
surmounted by a pyramidal roof of one or more stories; it contains the cell where the image of the 
god or his emblem is placed.
(ii) The porches or Mantapas, which always cover and precede the door leading to the cell.
(iii) Gopurams are the principal features in the quadrangular enclosures that surround the more 
notable temples.
(iv) Pillared halls or Chaultris - used for various purposes, and which are the invariable 
accompaniments of these temples.
Besides these, a temple always contains temple tanks or wells for water (used for sacred purposes 
or the

convenience of the priests); dwellings for all grades of the priesthood are attached to it, and 
other buildings for

state or convenience.

Examples: Brihadeshwara temple (Periya kovil) Tanjavur, Temple of gangaikondacholapuram

Vesara school

The Vesara style is also called as the Badami chalukya style. It has the combined features of both
Nagara and

Dravida style. The main reason behind the combination is the location of Badami Chalukyas, which 
was at the

buffer zone between northern Nagar style and southern Dravida style.

The Vesara style reduces the height of the temple towers even though the numbers of tiers are 
retained. This is accomplished by reducing the height of individual tiers.

   
   


 

The semi circular structures of the Buddhist chaityas are also borrowed as in the Durga temple at 
Aihole.
Virupaksha temple of Pattadakal is the finest example of Vesara style. The trend started by the 
Chalukyas of Badami was further refined by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta in Ellora, Chalukyas of 
Kalyani in Lakkundi, Dambal, Gadag etc. and epitomized by the Hoysala empire. The Hoysala temples 
at Belur, Halebidu and Somnathpura are supreme examples of this style.
The temples built in the Vesara style are found in other parts of India also. They include temples 
at Sirpur,
Baijnath, Baroli and Amarkantak.


Northern region Southern region In between. Combination of Dravida and Nagara
Shikhara is curvilinear Shikhara pyram idal

No role of pillar Pillar important No tank Tank may be there
No enclosure Enclosure and gopuram

Vimana

Ex: Mahadeva Temple, Kajuraho Ex: Brihadeshwara temple,

Tanjavur

Ex: Virupaksha temple, Pattadakal

33. Cave architecture

The earliest man-made caves date back to the 2nd century BC while the latest date to the 7th 
century AD. The

earlier caves were used by Buddhist and Jain monks as places of worship and residence. Some 
examples of this

type of cave structure are z era’ as and IY tzras of Buddhists. The great cave at Karle is one such 
example, where

great Chaityas and Viharas were excavated. The 7 zr/e cases are big in size and the interior is 
lighted up by great
windows.

   
   


 

Other than Buddhist caves many caves of Jains and Hindus were also escavated. Some of the famous 
and

prominent caves are at Nashik, Kanheri, Gaya (Barabar Hills), Bhaja, Nagarjunikonda, Badami, 
Elephanta and

Ellora.

Ajanta Caves

The cave temples of Ajanta are situated north of Aurangabad, Maharashtra. These caves were 
discovered by the British officers in 1819 AD. The thirty temples at Ajanta are set into the rocky 
sides of a crescent shaped gorge in the /  a&?  //s of the Sahyadri ranges. At the head of the 
gorge is a natural pool which is fed by a waterfall.
The earlier monuments include both cW// a W/is and zmasfer/es. These

date from the 2nd tO 1st centuries B.C. The excavations once again revived during the reign of the 
Vakataka ruler Harishena during Sth century.
The sculptures contain an impressive array of votive figures, accessory figures, narrative episodes 
and
decorative motifs.

The series of paintings is unparalleled in the history of Indian art, both for the wide range of
subjects and

the medium.
The caves depict a large number of incidents from the life of the Buddha (Jataka Tales). Cave 
number one contains wall frescos that include two great Bodhisattvas, Padmapani and

Avalokiteshvara. Other wonderful paintings in Ajanta are the flying apsara, dying princess and 
Buddha in

preaching mode.

Ellora Caves

Ellora is located at 30 km from the city of Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Ellora has 34 caves that are 
carved into the

sides of a basaltic hill. The caves at Ellora contain some of the finest specimens of cave-temple 
architecture and


   
   


 

exquisitely adorned interiors, built by the Rashtrakuta rulers. Ellora represents the epitome of 
Indian rock-cut

architecture.

The 12 Buddhist caves, 17 Hindu caves, and 5 Jain caves,

built in proximity, demonstrate the religious harmony prevalent during this period of Indian 
history.
The nobility, serenity and grace of Buddha are visible in the Buddhist caves of Ellora.
Ellora caves also contain images of Vishwakarma, the patron saint of Indian craftsmen.
The Kailasha temple in Cave 16 is indeed an architectural

wonder, the entire structure having been carved out of a monolith.
Bhimbetaka Caves

Bhimbetka is located in the Raisen District of Madhya Pradesh about 45 km to the southeast of 
Bhopal.

Bhimbetaka, discovered in 1958 by V.S. Wakanker, is the biggest prehistoric art depository in 
India.
Atop the hill a

large number of rock-shelters have been discovered, of which more than 130 contain paintings.
Excavations in some of the rock-shelters revealed history of continuous habitation from early stone 
age (about 10000 years) to the end of stone age (c. 10,000 to 2,000 years) as seen from 
artificially made stone tools and implements like hand-axes, cleavers, scrappers and knives.
Neolithic tools like points, trapezes and lunates made of chert and chalcedony, besides stone 
querns and grinders, decorated bone objects, pieces of ochre and human burials were also found 
here.
Elephanta Caves



   
   


 

The Elephanta Caves are a network of sculpted caves located on Elephanta Island in Mumbai Harbour. 
The island,

located on an arm of the Arabian Sea, consists of two groups of caves: the first is a large group 
of five Hindu caves,

the second, a smaller group of two Buddhist caves.

The Hindu caves contain rock cut stone sculptures, representing the Shaiva Hindu sect, dedicated to 
the
god Shiva. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock.

The 6th century Shiva temple in the Elephanta caves is one of the most exquisitely carved temples 
in India. The central attraction here is a twenty-foot high bust of the deity in three-headed form. 
His image symbolizes the fierce, feminine and meditative aspects of the great ascetic and the three 
heads represent Lord Shiva as Aghori, Ardhanarishvara and Mahayogi.
Aghori is the aggressive form of Shiva where he is intent on destruction.

Ardhanarishvara depicts Lord Shiva as half-man/half-woman signifying the essential unity of the 
sexes. The Mahayogi posture symbolises the meditative aspect.
All the caves were also originally painted in the past, but now only traces remain.

Mahakali Caves

These are rock-cut Buddhist caves situated in the Udayagiri hills, about 6.5km from Mumbai. These 
were

excavated during 200 BC to 600 AD and are now in ruins. They comprise of 4 caves on the 
southeastern face and

15 caves on the northwestern face. Cave 9 is the chief cave and is the oldest and consists of a 
stupa and figures of

Lord Buddha.


Jogeshwar and Kanheri Caves

Located in the western suburbs of Bombay, it is second largest known cave after the Kailasa cave in
Ellora and
houses a Brahmanical temple dating back to the 6th century AD.

   
   


 

Excavated between the 1st and 2nd centuries, the Kanheri is a 109-cave complex located near 
Borivili National

Park in Bombay. The Kanheri caves contain illustrations from Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism and 
show

carvings dating back to 200 BC. Karla and Bhaja Caves
About 50-60 kms away from Pune, these are rock-cut Buddhist caves dating back to the 1st and 2nd 
centuries BC.

The caves consist of several viharas and chaityas.

34. The Indo-Islamic Architecture

Indian architecture took new shape with the advent of Islamic rule in India towards the end of the 
12th
century AD.

New elements were introduced into the Indian architecture are: use of shapes (instead of natural 
forms)
inscriptional art using decorative lettering or ca/// a
inlay decoration and use of coloured marble, painted plaster and brilliantly glazed tiles Trabeate 
order was replaced by arcuate architecture i.e. an azc/z  cKzm' was adopted as a
method of

bridging a space. Shikara was replaced by Dome Concept of fzzzr was introduced for the first time
cementing agent in the form of alas for the first time in the construction of buildings in India

use of certain scientific and mechanical formulae which helped not only in obtaining greater 
strength and
stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and 
builders

This amalgamation of the Indian and the Islamic elements led to the emergence of a new style of 
architecture


Mosques

The mosque or masjid is a representation of Muslim art in its simplest form. The mosque is 
basically an open

   
   


 

courtyard surrounded by a pillared verandah, crowned off with a dome.

A zshaZt indicates the direction of the z;z'Z 'a for prayer

Towards the right of the mihrab stands the zz zzdar or pulpit from where the Imam presides over the 
proceedings.
An elevated platform, usually a fzzare/ from where the Faithful are summoned to attend the
prayers is an

invariable part of a mosque.

Large mosques where the faithful assemble for the Friday prayers are called the haze Eds/?zdz.

Tombs

The tomb or zza§de<a introduced an entirely new architectural concept. While the masjid was mainly 
known for its
simplicity, a tomb could range from being a simple affair (Aurangazeb's grave) to an awesome 
structure enveloped

in grandeur (Taj Mahal).

The tomb usually consists of solitary compartment or tomb chamber known as the 7dzr<ad in whose 
centre
is the cenotaph or zaz? z This entire structure is covered with an elaborate dome

In the underground chamber lies the mortuary or the z/sz;dzzza, in which the corpse is buried in a 
grave or
qabr

Normally the whole tomb complex or Razia is surrounded by an enclosure The tomb of a Muslim saint 
is called a z¥zrj;e'ñ
Almost all Islamic monuments were subjected to free use of verses from the Holy Koran and a great
amount of time was spent in carving out minute details on walls, ceilings, pillars and domes

35. Delhi Sultanate
The Delhi or the Imperial Style of Indo-Islamic architecture flourished between 1191-1557 AD and 
covered Muslim

dynasties viz., Slave (1191-1246), Khilji (1290-1320), Tughlaq (1320-1413), Sayyid (1414-1444) and
Lodi (1451-
   
   


 

1557).

Slave dynasty

This period marks the period of beginning of Indo — Islamic architecture. During this period mainly 
existing buildings

were converted.
The earliest construction work was began by Qutubuddin Aibak, who started erecting monumental 
buildings of stone on Qila Rai Pithora, the first of the seven historical

cities of Delhi.

The Qutb Mosque is one such building. Named as the zg anew‘- zd'-is/azzz de/?o’, it is considered 
as the earliest mosque in India.
Qutub-ud-din Aibak also started the construction of Qd’zz6 f'z¥z< in 1192 (which was

eventually completed by Iltutmish in 1230). Built to commemorate the entry of Islam it was 
essentially a victory tower. The diameter of the Qutub Minar is 14.32m at the base and about 2.75m 
at the top. It measures a height of 72.5m and contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps.
Shamsuddin Iltutmish extended the Quwwat-ul-Islam Masjid and built the tomb of his son Nasiruddin
Mohammed, which is locally known as the Wz’  z zrr.

He also started his own tomb (///z/f‘zz/s z's 7*crz ) located in the Qutub Minar complex in 1235 
AD.

The /‘crzfz W ZB/Zazz constructed in 1280 AD represents the first true arch built in India, which 
is produced by following the scientific system originally formulated by the Roman engineers.
Khilji dynasty

The real development of Indo-islamic architecture occurred during this period. 7Zo’sszzdr/  was 
widely used
and the influence of “ W/zrJ’ /’<az //crz can be seen here.

Allauddin Khilji established the second city of Delhi at Siri and built the &zr



He also built the far  Zbzue  near the Qutub Minar. The well-decorated
   
   


 

Alai Darwaza, which served as an entrance gateway to the mosque at the Qutub complex, marks the 
evolution of another innovative feature in the Indo-Islamic architecture.
The larval 7 zzzzz Eds/?d’ near Nizamuddin in Delhi and the Mia Eds/ñd’ in Bharatpur in Rajasthan 
were also built during this period.
Tughlaq dynasty

The rulers of the Tughlaq Dynasty also undertook considerable construction activities, including 
building three of

the seven ancient cities of Del hi. Use of zZey sazzd 'e  can be seen during this period. The 
architecture was

baussed  strezg¥'h not on the beauty. Hence zz/ z/zmoécora/’/crz is seen here. &  zgr its// is 
another
characteristic feature of Tuglaq architecture.

Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq built T  a‹fiz ad the third city of Delhi, in 1321-23 AD.

The Tczz c¥°  yas  n T  aq is an irregular pentagon in its exterior plan and its design is of the
pointed or "Tartar" shape and is crowned by a finial resembling the kalasa and amla of a Hindu 
temple.

Delhi's fourth city Ja/ezy:az¥z/z was built by Mohammad-bin-Tughlaq in mid-14th century.

Feroz Shah Tughlaq was undoubtedly the greatest builder among all the rulers of the Tughlaq 
dynasty. He built 7 zrazaZe@ Delhi's fifth city, in 1354 AD. The famous 77<zzz  A 7 ¥'/a  c¥rzzz' 
is the only remnant of its past
glory. He is also credited with founding the fortified cities of Jaunpur,

Fathabad and Hissar.

His construction works were of a unique simple style characterised by the use of inexpensive 
materials.
It was only Feroze Shah Tughlaq who took up large-scale restoration works and repaired hundreds
of

monuments, including the Qutub Minar which was damaged by lightening in 1369 AD.

   
   


 

Sayyid and Lodi dynasty

In the 14th century under the Timurid rulers, Islamic architecture underwent a change. The narrow 
horseshoe arch

was replaced by the laze' azcb, an idea imported directly from Persia. They used wooden beams as 
supports, and
eventually the four-centred arch minus the beam support came into vogue.

During the Sawid and the Lodi Dynasties, mainly the constructions of tombs were continued. More 
than fifty tombs

of different sizes were constructed.

The Lodis introduced the concept of otzrZz'e zXzses built one upon the other, leaving some space in 
between.
Two different types of tombs with octagonal and square plans respectively began to be constructed.
The Tombs of Mubarak Sayyid, Muhammad Sayyid and Sikander Lodi are all of the octagonal type.
The square tombs are represented by such monuments as the Bara Khan Ka Gumbad, Chota Khan Ka 
Gumbad, Bara Gumbad.
The Tomb of Isa Khan, the Tomb of Adham Khan, Moth ki Masjid, Jamala Masjid and the Qila-i- Kuhna
Masjid belong to the final phase of the Delhi style of architecture.

36. Provincial Style of Architecture

The Provincial Style of Architecture encompasses the architectural trends and developments noticed 
in different

provincial capitals in India. Bengal, Malwa, Kashmir, Jaunpur, Bijapur are some of the important 
provincial schools

existed during this time. Along with the Indo-Islamic style of architecture these provincial 
schools possessed certain
special characteristics:

Bengal school Use of bricks
   
   


 

Use of black marble

Ex: Tantipara Masjid, Chamkatti Masjid, Lotan Masjid Malwa schools
Absence of minar in mosque
Some European influence can also be seen in the later phase Ex: Mandu fort, Jahaj mahal

Kashmir school

Wooden architecture. The log construction using deodar trees for the construction of wooden bridges
called 4azdz/s or the wooden shrines called z?aza/s are the best illustrations of wooden 
architecture of
Kashmir.

Buddhist influence can also be seen

Ex: The mosque of Shah Hamdan in Srinagar, Jami Masj id at Srinagar

Jaunpur school

Absence of minars

Ex: Atala Masjid, Khalis Mukhlis Masj id Deccan school
distinct originality and independence of style

unique architectural style which is a mixture of Persian, Pathan and Hindu forms

Ex: Gulbarga Fort, Bidar Fort, Charminar, Mecca Masjid of Hyderabad, Golconda fort Bijapur school
development of the dome reached its acme Ceiling without support
Ex: Gol Gumbaz built by Mohammad Adil Shah (largest masonry dome in the world), Ibrahim Roza

   
   


 

37. Mughal architecture

The Mughal rulers were visionaries and their own personalities reflected in the all-round 
development of various

arts, crafts, music, building and architecture. The Mughal dynasty was established with the 
crushing victory of

Babar at Panipat in 1526 AD.

Babar

During his short five-year reign, Babar took considerable interest in erecting buildings, though 
few have
survived.

The mosque at 7BZxd'? Wj;dz at Panipat and the haz¥ Eds/?o’at Sambhal near Delhi, both constructed 
in
1526, are the surviving monuments of Babar.

Humayun

Babar's son Humayun laid the foundation of a city called ZZz/‹zzzxA ("refuge of the faithful") at 
the Purana
Qila in Delhi but the city could not be completed.

Humayun's tomb which was designed in 1564 by his widow Haji Begum, was the real

beginning of Mughal architecture in India. The important characteristics of Humayun's tomb are:
/2zarZzzj;dz style

Use of red' sazzdd'e

Use of round — bulb like dome

design of the Taj Mahal was modelled on this tomb

Akbar

Architecture flourished during the reign of Akbar. The chief feature of the architecture of Akbar's 
time was
the use of red'sazxdz/  .

The domes were of the "Lodi" type, while the pillar shafts were many-sided with the

   
   


 

capitals being in the form of bracket supports.
One of the first major building projects was the construction of a huge ml  a/  a. Creation of an 
entirely new capital city at /'/   @6z/. The buildings at Fatehpur

Sikri blended both Islamic and Hindu elements in their architectural style.
The Z d'adZB'<uza, the 73zwA d'7 z/ and the ZB'z  c¥° &/eezrz  sir are the most imposing of all the 
buildings of Fatehpur Sikri.

Jahangir

Jahangir concentrated more on painting and other forms of art than on building and architecture.
However,

some note-worthy monuments of his time include AZax’s Tcxz at R“/ra  a near Agra.

Some of the important features of Jahangir's architecture are:

Persian style, covered with enameled tiles Usage of marbles and precious gems
Usage of white marble and covered in pietra dura mosaic

Jahangir is the central figure in the development of the Mughal gardens. The most famous of his 
gardens is the  /ñz  2Bj;dz on the banks of Lake Dal in Kashmir.
£I'i“nad z/cfi u/a’s Tzx¥t is another important monument built during this period. It

was commissioned by Nur Jahan, the wife of Jahangir, for her father Mirza Ghiyas Beg, who had been 
given the title of I’timad-ud-DauIah (pillar of the state). Mirza Ghiyas Beg was also the 
grandfather of Mumtaz Mahal. The monument, also called as “Jewel box”, was built in White marble.
The JaW  <’s P6rzé at Shadera near Lahore, built by his wife Nur Mahal, is another outstanding 
architectural production of this time.
Shah jahan

The Mughal architecture reached its climax during the reign of Shah jahan. The single most 
important architectural


   
   


 

change was the substitution of marble for the red sandstone.

He demolished the austere sandstone structures of Akbar in the Red Fort and replaced them with 
marble
buildings such as the ZZ/tszz-?-hand the ZZisszz-/-7d'zas.

In 1638 he began to lay the city of   a/zzz¥zZao’ beside the river Jamuna.

The / w'  / a/ ZZ'/1 represents the pinnacle of centuries of experience in the construction of 
palaceforts.

Outside the fort, he built the has Eds/r@ the largest mosque in India.

He built the had Eds/?& a/  a in 1648 in honour of his daughter Jahanara Begum.

More than all these fine architectures, it is for building the T “ mls/ at Agra, he was

remembered often. It was built as a memorial to his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It is considered as 
the finest example of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements from Islamic, Persian, 
Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles.
Some of the important features of Taj mahal are: Use of white marble
More decoration Massive size
Use of char bagh style
Use of pietra dura technique Tomb building at its climax

Aurangazeb

The architectural projects of Aurangazeb's reign are represented by the &@-4/- d'§ aha, the tomb
of

Aurangzeb's wife Begum Rabia Durani, which is a poor replica of the famous Taj Mahal and is also 
called as Taj mahal of South India.
After the death of Aurangazeb, the Mughal architecture started declining. Aurangazeb's daughters


   
   


 

contributed in a small way in carrying forward the Mughal trend of architecture. Zinat-unnisa Begum 
built

the Jzzz/-zr/-Eds/?# at Daryaganj in Old Delhi.

The only significant monument built in the post-Aurangazeb time in Delhi was the &/z¥z< Jz«g”s
7*

built in 1753 by Mirza Mansoor Khan.

38. Colonial Architecture

European colonists brought with them to India concepts of their "world view" and a whole baggage of 
the history of

European architecture: Neo-Classical, Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance. The initial structures 
were utilitarian

warehouses and walled trading posts, giving way to fortified towns along the coastline.

Portuguese

The Portuguese adapted to India the climatically appropriate /Z ' azz galleried patio house and the
Baroque

churches of Goa.

2iY'ia/ azz7'Ar7z zz/°  e,o’?zrz of Goa were built in the typical Portuguese-Gothic style.

The D. /7 ads  z7xrzc/z at Cochin, built by the Portuguese in 1510, is believed to be the first 
church built
by the Europeans in India.

The Portuguese also built the /zzr/ c¥° /2wYe//a z›€'  zx¥z near Mumbai and added fortifications to 
the


Dutch

The Danish influence is evident in  ,oz/z¥zzpwhich was laid out in squares and canals and also in 
Tranquebar
and Serampore.

French

The French gave a distinct urban design to its settlement in Pondicherry by applying the 
zgzr/esrazz


jaw  and classical architectural patterns.
   
   


 

The Church of Sacred Heart of Jesus (Eglise De Sacre Coeur De Jesus), the Eglise de Notre Dame de
Anges and the Eglise de Notre Dame de Lourdes at Pondicherry have a distinct French influence.

British

It was the British who left a lasting impact on the India architecture. They saw themselves as the 
successors to the

Mughals and used architecture as a symbol of power. British started a new hybrid style of 
architecture called /xz›tz

— Wraceza“c sly/e or /  — Q4‘ c sly/e. It was a combination of Indian, Islamic and European 
architectures.

The first buildings were factories but later courts, schools, municipal halls and dak bungalows 
came up, which were ordinary structures, built by garrison engineers.
A deeper concern with architecture was exhibited in churches and other public

buildings. The Church of St. John at Calcutta built in 1787, St. Mary's Church in Fort St. George 
in Chennai are some of the examples.
Most of the buildings were adaptations of the buildings designed by leading

British architects in London and other places. The Indo-Gothic architecture flourished in different 
parts of India under the British.
Some of the important architecture are: Gateway of India — Mumbai, Chepak palace — Chennai,
Lakshmi

vilas palace — Baroda, Victoria memorial — Kolkata

The British built New Delhi as a systematically planned city after it was made the capital in 1911. 
&z


Zzd’ ezzr was made responsible for the overall plan of Delhi. He was specifically directed to 
"harmonise externally
with the traditions of Indian art".

The Western architecture with Oriental motif was realised with chajjas,

jalis and chhattris, as stylistic devices in the Viceroy's House (Rashtrapati Bhawan).


   
   


 

Herbert Baker added the imposing buildings of the South Block and the North Block, which flank the 
Rashtrapati Bhawan.
Another Englishman called Robert Tor Tussell built the Connaught Place and the Eastern and Western 
Courts.
St Martin's Garrison Church marks the culmination of the British architectural ventures in India. 
The

Church is a huge monolith with a high square tower and deeply sunken window ledges reminiscent of 
Dutch and German architecture.
6. Painting

Classification of Indian Paintings

Indian Paintings can be broadly classified as the mural paintings and miniature painting.

la/s are huge works executed on the walls of solid structures, as in the Ajanta Caves and the 
Kailashnath temple. They are also called as wall paintings.
/'la/ne paintings are executed on a very small scale on perishable material such as paper and
cloth.

Indian paintings provide an aesthetic continuum that extends from the early civilization to the 
present day. From

being essentially religious in purpose in the beginning, Indian painting has evolved over the years 
to become a

fusion of various cultures and traditions. The Indian painting was exposed to Greco-Roman as well 
as Iranian and

Chinese influences. Cave paintings in different parts of India bear testimony to these influences 
and a
continuous

evolution of new idioms is evident.

39. Mural painting

Ajanta Caves

The Ajanta Caves carved out of volcanic rock in the Maharashtra Plateau, situated near Aurangabad 
in Maharashtra.
Inside many of the caves are frescoes.

Frescoes are paintings which are done on wet plaster in which colours become

   
   


 

fixed as the plaster dries.

They are found on the walls and ceilings at Ajanta.

The paintings reflect different phases of Indian culture from buddha's birth to his mahaparinirvana 
in the 8th century AD.
Natural colours like white, green, brown, yellow, black, and a wonderful colour of blue is found.
The human & animal forms show a variety of graceful poses. Various methods were used to create the 
illusion of depth.
They depict themes of court life, feasting, processions, men and women at work, festivals and 
various natural scenes including animals, birds and flowers.
The place was not far off from the ancient trade routes & attracted traders & pilgrims through whom 
the
Ajanta art style diffused as far as China & Japan. Bagh Caves
Dhar district in Madhya Pradesh Buddhist in inspiration
Paintings are both secular and religious Influenced by Ajanta style of paintings
Most beautiful one is that of Avalokiteshvara Padmapani

Strong resemblance to the frescoes of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka.

Jain Caves

Jain cave temple complex in pudukottai district of tamil nadu Contains remnants of exquisite 
frescoes from 7th century Severely damaged due to vandalism
Detailed pictures of elephants, buffaloes, fish, geese, jains gathering lotuses from a

   
   


 

pond and dancing girls

Considered to be some of the best frescoes of medieval India next to frescoes of Ajanta Caves and 
Bagh Caves.







Lepakshi Painting

Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh beautiful paintings of Vijayanagar period
provides glimpses of contemporary dress like tall headwear (Kulavi), colored and embroidered sarees 
of both men and women in the paintings
Earth tones and complete absence of blue color in their painting

Costumes are outlined in black

40. Miniature painting

The miniatures, as the name indicates were small works, which were made on perishable material & 
hence no

definite proof of their birth & development can be traced. The Pala School
The Pala School of painting produced some of the earliest examples of

miniature painting in India. This school of painting dates back to 7‹h tO 11th century.
It was executed under the Palas of Bengal in the eastern India. This period witnessed the last 
great phase of Buddhism and of the Buddhist art in India.
The Pala painting is characterised by sinuous line and subdued tones of colour.

It is a naturalistic style which resembles the ideal forms of contemporary bronze and stone 
sculpture, and

   
   


 

reflects some feeling of the classical art of Ajanta. Here mostly the Palm leaf and paper were 
used.
The Western Indian School (12th IO 16a century AD)

The Western Indian style of painting prevailed in the region comprising Gujarat, Rajasthan and 
Malwa.
The motivating force for the artistic activity in Western India was Jainism.

The illustrations on these manuscripts are in a style of vigorous distortion. One

finds in this style an exaggeration of certain physical traits like the eyes and hips are enlarged.
Figures are flat, with angularity of features and the further eye protruding into space. This is an 
art of primitive vitality, vigorous line and forceful colours.
From about 1100 to 1400 A.D., palm-leaf was used for the manuscripts and later on paper was 
introduced
for the purpose.

The Mughal School (1560-1800 A.D)

The Mughal emperors introduced their own style of painting with Persian inspiration and added new
themes, colours and forms. Court scenes were depicted in grandeur. The background was usually hilly

landscapes. Flowers and animals were also vastly depicted.

The Mughal paintings are characterized by their subtleness and naturalism and often depict 
historical
events or court life.

Akbar:

Akbar's attitude led to a conscious synthesis of Hindu idioms and Indian aesthetics with the 
Islamic cult and elements of imperial Safavid Iran.
Illustrative serialisation of texts like Ramayana, Tutinama, Akbarnama etc was the mode

   
   


 

of painting of this phase.

Portraiture was a rarity and female portraits yet greater. Well packed composition, well

proportioned physiognomy and beautifully rounded faces, depiction of motion and a highly populated 
canvas characterised the art style of this early phase.
Jahangir:

The art of post-Akbar era did not have the illustrative thrust. The earlier boldness was

replaced by a touch of softness. The earlier crowded canvas had now a lot of breathing space.
Jahangir's poetic genius endowed with fine imagery and lyricism reflected in the art of his era.
Portraits of birds and animals in this era are timeless world classics.

His interaction with European world brought the European technique of shading and producing 
threedimensional
effects to Indian painting.

Shah jahan:

Shahjahan continued Mughals' art cult, though with lesser thrust. Romantic in temperament, 
Shahjahan, little liked violence and ugliness.
Portraits and random themes like durbar scenes, processions, festivals, scenes of outings etc were 
referred.
Aurangzeb:

Aurangzeb being a conservative Muslim had no place for art in his court.

After he died several Mughal governors and Rajput state acclaimed sovereignty.

Painters of the Mughal court sought refuge in these states. They carried with them the Mughal art- 
style
which was amalgamated with the taste and likings of their new patrons and local elements.


   
   


 

This amalgamation created a new art-style widely known as Om/via/ d g sz/. Awadh became the
foremost seat of the Provincial Mughal art.

Rajput Paintings

The Rajput paintings flourished under the patronage of the Hindu Rajput rulers of Rajputana and 
Punjab
Himalayas during the period 1500 AD to the middle of the 19th century.

Rajput painting was initially known for its use of a limited range of color, shallow space, 
decorative

brilliance and mythic subject matter. Later, the Mughal influences were absorbed into Rajput art in 
varying

degrees, due to changes in the patronage, the movement of artists and political factors.

The Rajput paintings can be put under two broad groups: the Rajasthani style and the Pahari style.

1. Rajasthani style

Rajasthani paintings are those works that have been executed in

Rajputana, from Bikaner to the border of Gujarat and from Jodhpur to Gwalior and Ujjain.
The themes of the paintings were mostly xe//p'cxxs az¥:/ he  szz@ecz’s,

based on Lord Rama and Lord Krishna. Court scenes were depicted as also royal portraits.
Z2 'd’ zzd’/?zzzs aA&r//?az ' cz¥'  s are characteristic of the Rajasthani paintings.
The romance of Padmavati, penned by the poet Malik Muhammad Jaisi, provided a common
theme to

the Rajput paintings. Illustrations of Mahabharata, Bana Bhatta's Kadambari, the Panchatantra were 
painted.
The Rajput painting developed individual styles in Bundi, Kota, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Kishangarh.

2. Pahari Style

Various schools of miniature painting collectively called Pahari, flourished

   
   


 

between the 17th and 19th centuries in the sub-Himalayan hilly states towards the end of the Mughal 
rule in India. These areas were ruled by the Rajput kings and chieftains.
With the infusion of new ideas and techniques these schools attained a

level of maturity and sophistication, which made them worthy successors of the Mughal tradition.
This art dwelt largely on the /’7 ezies azz:/ sets from literature and mythology. Love is the 
inspiration and the main pre-occupation of the Pahari School symbolized by E?s7zzz azz:/'7Bz z.
A typical Pahari composition consists of several figures skillfully grouped and full of movement, 
and

each is distinctive in terms of clothing, hairstyle and even pigmentation, which may be blue, 
white, pink

or grey.

In 1690, ZBSA?, a hill-state on the banks of Ravi, was the first to initiate the art of the 
hill-region
by

illustrating literary classics like Rasa Manjari, Ramayana, Gita Govinda. Other centres like 
Chamba, Kangra, Srinagar etc developed later.
The Himalayan perspective and moderately statured alluring men and women with round faces and
small but deep eyes, set below a semi-circular forehead impart to Pahari art its unity and 
distinction.

Deccani School

Deccani painting denotes broadly the miniature painting from the 16th Century to the 19th

Century at Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Golkonda and Hyderabad, the former states that formed the region 
known as Deccan.
The <?c z cz¥’c¥zz sets, the palm trees, animals and men and women all belong, to the Deccani 
tradition.
Early Deccani painting absorbed influences of the northern tradition of the pre-Mughal

painting which was flourishing in Malwa, and of the southern tradition of the Vijayanagar murals as 
evident in the treatment of female types and costumes.
   
   


 
Influence of the Persian painting is also observed in the treatment of the horizon gold sky and 
landscape.

Tanjore paintings

A style of painting characterised by bold drawing, techniques of shading and the use of pure and 
brilliant colours flourished at Tanjore in South India during the late 18th and 19th centuries.
The paintings are notable for their adornment in the form of sezz -Dec/c¥xs sz'crzzs,

pearls, glass pieces and gold. The zrc7z r&azz" co'ms, dashes of gold, semi-precious stones and 
fine artistic work are characteristics of these paintings.
The paintings are mostly of z2xdr and Goddesses because this art of painting

flourished at a time when fine-looking and striking temples were being constructed by rulers of 
several dynasties.
The figures in these paintings are large and the faces are round and divine.

Madhubani School

Madhubani painting is a style of painting, practiced in the W/  /a z  zrz of Bihar state.
Themes revolve around Hindu Gods and mythology, along with scenes from the royal court and
social

events like weddings.

Generally no space is left empty; the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and 
even
geometric designs.

Paintings are traditionally done on freshly ,Q’as/’ezed'zznd' its/is and floors of huts and 
painters are mainly
women.

Painting is done with fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens and matchsticks, using zzz/zzza/ Yes azx/


The artists use leaf, Herbs, Flowers to make the colour which is used to draw paintings.
   
   


 

Modern Painting

Raja Ravi Verma

Raja Ravi Verma of Kerala was perhaps the first great modern painter in India.

He evolved a national style of painting by combining various regional elements like costumes, 
jewellery
and facial features. His paintings, which mostly depicted mythological themes, became very popular 
not only in India but abroad.
His illustrations of Ramayana and Mahabharata were the most appealing visual representations of 
that
time. He won a gold medal at the World Art Exhibition, Vienna, for his picture Nair Lady Adorning 
Her Hair.
Bengal school

zfi'  az¥z/h Page and /'key'/, who founded the Bengal School of Painting, were the pioneers
in

encouraging Indian themes.

Abanindranath Tagore's Arabian Nights series (1930) is among his renowned works.

Other renowned painters like Nandlal Bose, Devi Prasad Roy, Sarada Charan Ukil, Asit Kumar
Haldar

also belonged to this school.

Cazz/l  another renowned Indian painter, modelled his work on the folk art of Bengal. He

adopted the angular forms and harsh lines of the village patuas and used the village dyes in his 
paintings.
/gtD“  az›a/h Page started painting in 1930 at the age of 67 and produced some great paintings,
which are very individualistic and modem in style. He held the first exhibition of his paintings in 
Galerie

Pigalle in Paris in 1930.

Independence saw the setting up of a new school of art in Bombay called the &  ess w


   
   


 

The prominent artists of this group are Francis Newton Souza the founder, Maqbool Fida Husain,

S.H.Raza, H.A.Gade, S.K.Bakre and others. Painting took a new form in this period - bold and 
furious at

one end, soft and magical at the other.

By 1960, professional art galleries were opened in Delhi and Mumbai, and in the next two decades 
several
abstract painters like V.S. Gaitonde, Balraj Khanna and J.Swaminathan emerged on the scene.

Gulam Muhammed Sheikh, K.K.Hebber, Satish Gujral, S.H.Raza (Surya), Akbar Padamsee (Woman),
Tyeb Mehta (Figure with Bird), Krishna Khanna (St Francis and the Wolf) are some other prominent 
names

of India's contemporary art scene.

The South India saw the proliferation of good painters like K.C.S.Pannikker, K.Madhava Menon, 
P.L.Narasimhamurty and Mokkapti Krishnamurti.
Among the contemporary modem Indian women painters, mention may be made of Anjolie Ela Menon,
Arpana Caur, B.Prabha, Kamala Das and Lalitha Lajmi.

7. Music

41. Origin and development of Indian Music

The origin of Indian music can be traced back to Vedic days. The Sama Veda has all the seven notes 
of the raga

4ara/ztx r a in the descending order. The earliest Raga is speculated to be 'Sama Raga’. ZZzzra/a’s


Uma  (4th Century AD) contains several chapters on music. This is probably the first work that 
clearly elaborated
the octave and divided it into 22 keys.

In the beginning music was devotional in content and was purely used for ritualistic purposes and
was
restricted to temples.

Between 2 to 7 AD a form of music called CaZal &zgjee/, which was written in Sanskrit, became very

   
   


 
popular. This form gave way to a simpler form called  wa  which used Hindi as the medium. The Gupta 
Period is considered as the golden era in the development of Indian music. All the
MUSIC

treatises like Natya Shastra and Brihaddeshi were written during this period.

In the 15th century AD, as a result of the patronage given to the classical music by the rulers, 
the devotional Dhruvapad transformed into the lzz,o a’form of singing.
The P/szpa/ developed as a new form of singing in the 18th century AD.

Historical roots of both W  la  and /gz<zzzz’/c classical music traditions stem from Bharata's 
Natyashastra. The two traditions started to diverge only around 14th Century AD.
Carnatic music is kriti based and saahitya (lyric) oriented, while Hindustani music emphasises on 
the
musical structure and the possibilities of improvisation in it.

Hindustani music adopted a scale of Shudha Swara saptaka (octave of natural notes) while Carnatic 
music
retained the traditional octave.

42. Pillars of Indian music

Swara, Raaga and Tala are considered the three pillars of Indian Music.

Swar

Swar means a note in the octave. The seven basic notes of the scale (swaras), in Indian music are 
named shadja,

rishabh, gandhar, madhyam, pancham, dhaivat and nishad, and are shortened to &, 7Z, zz, W,


It is believed that primitive sound Oum gave birth to Swar.

Swar is also called "szr". At a fundamental level they are similar to the sob/a of Western music. 
Two of the swar
are noteworthy in that they are immutably fixed. These two notes are shadja (Sa) and pancham (Pa)
and are

referred to as "axle/a suss". These two swar form the tonal foundation for all the Indian classical 
music. The other

notes have alternate forms and are called " /zz/a suss”.


   
   


 

The swar have special relationships with each other. Although there are only seven notes they 
repeat in the upper

and lower directions. Therefore, when ascending the scale when one reaches Ni, then the scales 
starts over with

Sa, Re, Ga, etc. This is the zz  z  slew. By the same token when one is decsending the scale, it 
does not stop

at Sa but continues down as Ni, Dha, etc.; this is the la  zzg 'seer.

Raga

In the Indian Classical Music, Raga is the basis of melody and Tala is the basis of rhythm. Each 
melodic structure

of Raga has something akin to a distinct personality subject and to a prevailing mood. Ragas 
involve several important elements.
The first element is sound -- metaphysical and physical, which is referred to as 7Bz¥z. There are 
two types
of nada, azzz7 rna zzzzdz or un-struck sound and a7 z/’a zaz¥z or struck sound.

The next element of raga is @/c z, relegated into sea  (whole and half tones), and s<za‘r 
(microtones).

Raga also involves the production of emotional effects in the performer and listener, which are
known as

masa. There are nine rasas: Love (Shringar), Humour (Hasya), Pathos (Karuna), Anger (Rudra),
Heroism

(Vir), Terror (Bhayanaka), Disgust (Veebhatsa) and Wonder (Abdhuta).

Raga is based on the principle of a combination of notes selected out the 22 note intervals of the 
octave.
There are 72 ’has’, or parent scales, on which Ragas are based. Ragas are placed in three 
categories:
(a) zgdz  or pentatonic, a composition of five notes

(b)  z¥z  or hexatonic, a composition of six notes

(c) size or heptatonic, a composition of seven notes

Every Raga must have at least five notes, starting at Sa, one principal note, a second important 
note
and a few


   
   


 

helping notes. The speed of a raga is divided into three parts: fY/all (slow), &  a (Medium) and &z 
' (fast).

Ragas are classified under six principal categories -- Wzx€y', fled:em,


Other ragas are derived from these six ragas. The first derivatives of the ragas are called 
zaj;z1s, and each of the

six ragas has five raginis under them. All the ragas are supposed to have been derived from their
//zna/s. Every

raga has a fixed number of komal (soft) or teevra (sharp) notes from which the thaat can be 
recognized.

Ragas in the Carnatic music fall into two categories, the base or x s/'ala</a may and the derived 
or


The 16 swaras form the basis for the melakarta scheme. Melakarta ragas have a formal structure and 
follow a fairly
rigid scheme of scientific organization whereas the janya ragas are rooted in usage and are liable 
to evolve with the

music.

Tata

Tala is the rhythmical groupings of beats. These rhythmic cycles range from 3 to 108 beats. It is 
the theory of time

measure and has the same principle in Hindustani and Carnatic music, though the names and styles 
differ.

Tala is independent of the music it accompanies and has its own divisions.

Different talas are recognised like Dadra, Rupak, Jhaptal, Ektal, Adha-Chautal and Teen-Tal.

There are over a 100 Talas, but only 30 Talas are known and only about 10-12 talas are actually 
used.

The most commonly encountered one is the one with sixteen beats called the 7*eez 'aa/.

The Zap is the tempo, which keeps the uniformity of time span. The WJ‘za is the smallest unit of 
the tala.
Carnatic music has a rigid thala structure. The thalas are defined on the basis of intricate 
arithmetic calculations.

The thalas are made up of three basic units, namely, /a  &zd’axrzand azxz &zd’amThe most common 
thala is

   
   


 

the  /7 '/a, which consists of a repeating measure of 8 beats.

day Alap is the first movement of the Raga. It is a slow, serene movement acting as an invocation 
and it
gradually develops the Raga.

Jor begins with the added element of rhythm which, combining with the weaving of
innumerable

melodic patterns, gradually grains in tempo and brings the raga to the final movement.

he/a Jhala is the final movement and climax. It is played with a very fast action of the plectrum 
that is
worn on the right index finger.

: It is the fixed composition. A gat can be in any tala and can be spread over from 2 to 16 of its 
rhythmic
cycles in any tempo, slow, medium or fast. A gat, whether vocal or instrumental, has generally two

sections. The first part is called  //  ?” (Carnatic) or blazer ” (Hindustani) which opens the
composition

and is generally confined to the lower and middle octaves. The following part of the composition is 
called

the  z¥r,‹zz//au' ” (or antara) which usually extends from the middle to upper octaves. In Carnatic 
music

further melodic sections called 7¥zzazzz” follows the zxr/zz// ?. ”

43. Comparison of Hindustani and Carnatic music

Carnatic and Hindustani are different in terms of their style, characteristics and the like.

Carnatic music belongs to the south Indian states, namely Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka
and

Kerala. In fact it is more popular in these regions than in north India, which is predominantly 
characterized
by Hindustani classical.

In Hindustani music outside infuelnce such as Arab, Afghan and Persian can be seen. But the 
Carnatic
music is totally indigenous.



   
   


 

Carnatic music differs from the Hindustani in the sense, that it pays more importance to the 
literary part of
singing, that is, it gives more importance to the song as a whole during performance.

In Hindustani music, the music instrument is given equal importance. But in Carnatic, more 
importance is
given to vocal music than instrument.

A song composed in the carnatic style necessarily comprises of a Pallavi, Anupallavi and one or two 
or
more Charanas. Each of these parts of the song is given importance, while singing in the Carnatic 
style.

This is not the case with Hindustani music. The Hindustani musicians give more importance to the 
raga

part of music.

Carnatic music has its own way of delineating raga. It does with alapana in the beginning. Alapana 
consists
in the elaboration of the particular raga in which the Kriti is composed. The alapana is followed 
by the

rendering of Pallavi. It is followed by Niraval accompanied by Kalpita Svaras. The musician is 
given the

liberty to explore the raga and the various aspects of raga finally concluding with the Kriti.

Unlike Hindustani music, Carnatic music does not adhere to Time or Samay concepts and instead
of

Thaats, Carnatic music follows the Melakarta concept.

44. Hindustani music

In Hindustani music, there are 10 main forms of styles of singing and compositions: Dhrupad, 
Dhamar, Hori,

Khayal, Tappa, Chaturang, Ragasagar, Tarana, Sargam and Thumri.

Dhrupad

The word 'Dhrupad’ is derived from 'Dhruva’ meaning fixed and ’pada' meaning words or song.
Therefore, the term

dhrupad means "the literal rendering of verse into music" and so the songs have a particularly 
potent impact.

Dhrupad is the oldest and perhaps the grandest form of Hindustani vocal music.

   
   


 

Dhrupad was essentially devotional in essence.

Dhrupad reached its pinnacle of glory during Akbar's reign when stalwarts like Swami Haridas, Baba 
Gopal
Das, Tansen and Baiju Bawra performed it.

It was adapted for court performance during the reign of Raja Man Singh Tomar (1486-1517) of 
Gwalior.

Dhrupad is essentially a poetic form incorporated into an extended presentation style marked by 
precise
and orderly elaboration of a raga. The exposition preceding the composed verses is called afap, and 
is
usually the longest portion of the performance.

Dhrupad compositions have four parts or stanzas.

There are four forms of Dhrupad singing: Dagar Bani, Khandaar Bani, Nauhar Bani and Gauhar Bani.
Khayal

Khayal literally means ‘a stray thought’, ‘a lyric' and ’an imagination'. This is the most 
prominent genre of Hindustani

vocal music depicting a romantic style of singing.

Khayal originated as a popular form of music in the 18th century AD and was ultimate in the 
blending of
Hindu and Persian cultures.

The most important features of a Khayal are 'Tans’ or the running glides over notes and 'Bol-tans' 
which
distinguish it from Dhrupad.

Thumri

Thumri originated in the Eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, mainly in Lucknow and Benares, around the 
18th century

AD.

Thumri was developed by the famous musician Sadiq Ali Shah.
It is believed to have been influenced by hori, kajri and dadra, popular in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. 
Thumri is supposed to be a romantic and erotic style of singing and is also called “ /'  / vie 6¥°
/zz:d'azz



The song compositions are mostly of love, separation and devotion. Its most distinct feature is the 
erotic
subject matter picturesquely portraying the various episodes from the lives of Lord Krishna and 
Radha.

Thumris are composed in lighter ragas and have simpler talas.

There are three main gharanas of thumri - Benaras, Lucknow and Patiala.

Dadra

Dadra bears a close resemblance to the Thumri. The texts are as amorous as those of Thumris. The 
major

difference is that dadras have more than one antara and are in dadra tala. Singers usually sing a 
dadra after a

thumri.

Dhamar-Hori

These compositions are similar to Dhrupad but are chiefly associated with the festival of  /. Here 
the



   
   


 

compositions are specifically in praise of Lord Krishna. This music, sung in the dhamar tala, is 
chiefly used in

festivals like Janmashthami, Ramnavami and Holi.

Hori is a type of dhrupad sung on the festival of Holi. The compositions here describe the spring 
season. These

compositions are mainly based on the love pranks of 7grz e-  rs/x¥z Tappa
The tappa is said to have developed in the late 18th Century AD from the folk songs of cane/ 
&?vers. The credit
for its development goes to Shorey Mian or Ghulam Nabi of Multan.

Tappa literally means 'jump’ in Persian.

They are essentially folklore of love and passion and are written in Punjabi.

Its beauty lies in the quick and intricate display of various permutations and combinations of 
notes. The compositions are very short and are based on Shringara Rasa.
Varanasi and Gwalior are the strongholds of Tappa.

Ragasagar

Ragasagar consists of different parts of musical passages in different ragas as one song 
composition.
These

compositions have 8 to 12 different ragas and the lyrics indicate the change of the ragas. The 
peculiarity of this

style depends on how smoothly the musical passages change along with the change of ragas. Tarana
Tarana is a style consisting of peculiar syllables woven into rhythmical patterns as a song. It is 
usually sung in

faster tempo.

Chaturang

Chaturang denotes four colours or a composition of a song in four parts: Fast Khayal, Tarana,
Sargam and a

"Paran" of Tabla or Pakhwaj. Ghazal

   
   


 

The ghazal is mainly a poetic form than a musical form, but it is more song-like than the thumri. 
The ghazal is

described as the "pride of Urdu poetry".

The ghazal originated in Iran in the 10th Century AD. It grew out of the Persian guslz¥z, a poem 
written in
praise of a king, a benefactor or a nobleman.

The ghazal never exceeds 12 shers (couplets) and on an average, ghazals usually have about 7 shers.

Even though ghazal began with Amir Khusro in northern India, Deccan in the south was its home in 
the
early stages. It developed and evolved in the courts of Golconda and Bijapur under the patronage of 
Muslim rulers.
The 18th and 19th centuries are regarded as the golden period of the ghazal with Delhi and Lucknow 
being
its main centres.

45. Carnatic Music

Carnatic music is confined to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In Carnatic music 
there is a very

highly developed theoretical system. It is based upon a complex system of Ragam (Raga) and Thalam 
(Tala).

Most compositions in Carnatic music have three parts to their body.

(i) The first two lines of the song are called 73r//er. They occur over and over, especially after 
each stanza.
(ii) Usually the Pallavi is followed by two more lines or sometimes just one more. This portion is 
called


73z//a . This is sung at the beginning for sure, but sometimes even during the end of the song, but 
not

necessarily after each stanza.

(iii) The stanzas of a song are called z7zzzazexd.

73rzazx rzz¥zs (1480-1564) is considered to be the father of Carnatic music. To him goes the credit 
of codification of
the method of Carnatic music. He is also credited with creation of several thousand songs. Another 
great name
   
   


 

associated with Carnatic music is that of Idrdraz’'4   z¥. He is regarded as the grand theorist of 
Carnatic

music. He also developed "Melankara", the system for classifying south Indian ragas.

It was in the 18th century that Carnatic music acquired its present form. This was the period that 
saw the "trinity" of

Carnatic music; 7Z aj;stx a, km    /x? and W   sz¥ ZZ4s1/az compile their famous compositions.

Id<z¥tzzrIt is a composition usually sung or played at the beginning of a recital and reveals the 
general form of
the Raga. The Varnam is made up of two parts: 1) the 73rz zg¥t or first half and 2) the ZY/azazgzz 
or second
half. The two halves are almost equal in length.

W?f/: It is a highly evolved musical song set to a certain raga and fixed tala or rhythmic cycle. 
7dgzzzzz It is a melodic improvisation in free rhythm played without mridangam accompaniment. 
haz¥zzzz It is another style of melodic improvisation in free rhythm.
73z//a : This is a short pre-composed melodic theme with words and set to one cycle of tala. Here 
the soloist
improvises new melodies built around the word pallavi.

7z?4a/azzzIt is the section where the Pallavi is played in three tempi keeping the Tala constant.

Bara-/fiz//:eve'. It is the improvised section performed with the drummer in medium and fast 
speeds.

m/dia This is the final part of the Pallavi where the soloist improvises freely and comes back
to the

original theme at the end.

46. Devotional Music

In the Vedic period (3000-1500 BC), music was solely ritualistic. Some of the major earlier forms 
of Indian Classical

music like OaZazx z &zg/oe/ and  wa,/zzz¥z were all devotional in character. Gradually other forms 
of
devotional music like bhajans, kirtans, shahbads and qawwalis came into being.

Bhajan
   
   


 

Bhajans owe their origin to the Bhakti Movement. The word bhajan is derived from bhaj which means
to serve’ in Sanskrit.
Bhajan is a popular form of devotional singing prevalent in north India.

It is usually sung in temples in praise of god or is addressed as a plea to him.

Bhajans are usually sung in groups. There is a lead singer who sings the first line or stanza and 
is followed
by the choir.

The compositions are usually based on  zz‘a 7Bsa. Stories and episodes from the Ramayana
and

Mahabharata are popular themes for bhajans, as are the episodes from the lives of Lord Rama, Lord 
Krishna and Lord Shiva.
Bhajan singing is usually accompanied by musical instruments like jhanj, manjira, daphli, dholak 
and
chimta.

Meera Bai, Kabir, Surdas, Tulsidas, Guru Nanak and Narsi Mehta are some of the most significant
names

in bhajan singing.

Kirtan

Kirtans are another type of folk music usually sung by the Vaishnavas and are based on the love 
stories of
Krishna and Radha. It is prevalent in Bengal.

Kirtans were transformed into song and dance congregations by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (15-16th Century
AD), drawing inspiration from Jayadeva's Geet Govinda.

Kirtans are of two types: Nama-Kirtana and Lila-Kirtana. The first involves constant uttering of 
the name
and singing of the glory of God, while the second describes the various anecdotes of the Radha-
Krishna

love.

   
   


 

The singing of Kirtans is accompanied by musical instruments like mridanga and cymbals.

Qawwali

Qawwali is a devotional form of music, prevalent among the szd°ds.

The lyrics are in praise of Allah, Prophet Mohammad, members of Prophet's family or renowned Sufi
saints.

It is written in Persian, Urdu and Hindi and is composed in a specific raga. Qawwali is usually 
sung in a group, with one or two lead singers.
Originally it was sung to the beat of the daff. However, now the Qawwali singing is accompanied by 
the
dholak, tabla, manjira and the harmonium.
The Sabri brothers, Aziz Nazaan, Aziz Mian, Late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Late Aziz Warisi are 
important names in qawwali singing.

Shabad

Shabads are devotional songs of the &4 zs sung in gurdwaras on religious occasions. They are
ascribed to

Sikh gurus and many Bhakti saint-poets.

Shabad originated as a musical composition around the 17th century AD. Guru Nanak and his disciple
Mardana are credited with the development and popularity of shabad.

Shabads are sung to the accompaniment of the harmonium, tabla and often the dholak and chimta.

Today, three distinct styles exist in shabad singing. They are raga-based shabads, traditional 
shabads as
mentioned in the Adi Granth and those based on lighter tunes.

The Singh Bandhu are today the most eminent shabad singers. D.V.PaIuskar and Vinayak Rao
Patvardhan

also sang shabads.

47. Folk Music

   
   


 

Following are some of the important folk music in India:

Z 'haram/azxf' fa//r znisi“c had its root in the lap of nature. The pure and blessed music have the

Rajasthan's desert culture.
48. Musical Instruments

It is widely believed that the earliest known Indian instruments evolved from the Z7¥z  
azz'zazrz(bow and arrow)

used by primitive tribes for hunting, as also to signal the advent of the enemy. Excavations at the 
Indus Valley site

have revealed many kinds of musical instruments. These were mainly made of bamboo, bone and animal 
skins and

bear close resemblance to modern veena and mridangam.

Many Greaco-Buddhist sculptures belonging to the period Sth Century B.C. to 2nd Century A.D. also 
depict a

wealth of string, wind and percussion instruments.

According to the Natyasastra of Bharatha, there are four classes of musical instruments: Tata or 
Tantu (stringed),

Avanaddha (percussion or drums), Ghana (bells, cymbals and gongs), and Sushira (wind). The classes 
of instruments are divided as follows:
1. Ghana Vadya (Idiophones)

2. Avanaddha Vadya (Membranophones)

3. Sushira Vadya (Aerophones)

4. Tata Vadya (Chordophones)

8. Dance

49. Origin of Indian Dance

In India, dance and music pervade all aspects of life and bring colour, joy and gaiety to a number 
of festivals and

ceremonies. In India dance is considered to be divine in origin.

Shiva's cosmic dance, Paz›c trnai,s believed to encompass creation, preservation, and destruction 
and this
idea has been embedded in Hindu thought and ritual since the dawn of civilization.

The dances of Kali, the dark and fierce Goddess of destruction, are very significant. Krishna is 
one of the most popular dancing divinities of the Hindus.
The common root of all classical dance forms can be traced to Z7zara/a’s 7B/' asas/<a. It contains
deliberations on

the different kind of postures, the mudras, the kind of emotions, the kind of attires, the stage, 
the ornaments and

the audience. According to the Natyashastra, Brahma, the creator of the Universe, created drama. He 
took,

pathya (words) form the Rigveda abhinaya (gesture) from the Yajurveda geet (music and chant) from 
Samaveda
rasa (sentiment and emotional element) from Atharvaveda

to form the fifth Veda, Natyaveda.

There are ample evidences of the popularity of dance in the Indian society right from the 
Mesolithic period. The first

and the oldest of evidences to date are the discovery of the bronze figurine of a dancer from the 
Indus Valley

Civilization excavations at Mohenjodaro and Harappa.

50. Classical Dance

   
   


 

Indian classical dances are dances of the mind and soul and are extremely traditional. It is very 
sensuous but the

experience of azzzzz8 (bliss) it evokes is very spiritual.

7Bsa (mood or flavour) as the cause of ananda (bliss) is considered fundamental essence of beauty 
and
harmony in Indian aesthetics.

1fZzga«a’ (cause of emotion), az¥rZ zzia (effect of emotion) and syw zr/ or  a  c zr/ Zz aizz 
(subordinate emotions) constitute the state of rasa.
These in their respective order change the &7 z ? Siva (primary emotion) into rasa or bliss.

All dance forms are thus structured around the nine rasas or emotions:

1. 7dsja (happiness)

2. Ec< z'z (anger)

3. dZas 'a (disgust)

4. ZZeja (fear)

5. la  (sorrow)

6. IY<azrz(courage)

7. 7 zzzezz (compassion)

8. la   (wonder)

9. dzd'a (serenity)

All dance forms follow the same hand gestures or 7 ez/'a has  for each of these rasas.

Indian dance is divided into wr//a - the rhythmic elements, wr/ a - the combination of rhythm with 
expression and

zzz/ga - the dramatic element. Nritya is usually expressed through the eyes, hands and facial 
movements. Nritya
combined with nritta makes up the usual dance programmes. Later, as the art evolved, other 
distinctions were

described, including the male (/azzdza) or powerful, strong, firm aspect, and the female (/as a), 
soft, flowing and
subtle.


   
   


 

There are four strong elements of the classical dance form: s7 zs '<a, scu//: 'use, Fakir

/xaz /rzrz and arias' /?/ara/’we. These traditions were kept alive by a long and distinguished line 
of "Gurus" who dedicated their lives to perfecting the art form and handing it down to the next 
generation. This tradition is known as the 7z<zz- Rsta


India offers a number of classical and semi-classical dance forms, each of which can be traced to 
different parts of the country. Each form represents the culture and ethos of a particular region 
or a group of people. Classical dances recognized by the Government of India are: Bharatnatyam, 
Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Kathak, Manipuri, Odissi and Sattriya.
1. Bharatanatyam
Bharatanatyam is a classical Indian dance form originating in Tamil Nadu. Bharatanatyam is 
considered to be over 2000 years old. In Bharata Muni's Natya

Shastra Bharatanatyam is described as eta ex a in which one dancer depicts many roles. Siva as 
Nataraja, the Lord of Dance is depicted in various dance forms.
Bharatnatyam leans heavily on the abhinaya or mime aspect of dance - the nritya, where the dancer
expresses the sahitya through movement and mime (gestures and facial expression).

Bharatanatyam is usually accompanied by the classical music.

BHA- Bhava (Expression), RA- Raga (Music) and TA- Tala (Rhythm) Bharatanatyam is a traditional

2. Kuchipudi

Kuchipudi is originally from Andhra Pradesh.

Its evolution can be traced to traditional dance - drama, known under the


   
   


 

generic name of Yakshagaana.

It originated in the seventh century AD.

In 17th century A.D. Siddhendra Yogi, a talented Vaishnava poet,

conceived Kuchipudi style of Yakshagaana. It begins with an invocation to Lord Ganesha followed by 
nritta (non-narrative and abstract dancing); shabdam (narrative dancing) and natya.

Noted Kuchipudi exponents are: Raja Reddy and Radha reddy, Sonal Mansingh, Yamini Krishnamurthy
3. Kathak

Kathak dance is originally from Uttar Pradesh. It is a combination of music, dance and narrative.
The name Kathak is derived from the Sanskrit word Ca/7zz meaning story. This dance

form traces its origins to the nomadic bards of ancient northern India, known as Kathaks, or 
storytellers.
The present day Kathak dance mainly depends on the medieval period 7Bs ZY/a, a local dance in the 
Braj region of Uttar Pradesh.
Eventually popular Kathak became highly stylised in both Hindu and Muslim courts and came to be 
regarded as a sophisticated form of entertainment.
There are three major schools or gharanas of Kathak from which performers today generally draw 
their

   
   


 

lineage


- It came into existence mainly in the court of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah the ruler of Awadh in the 
early 19th century.

- The Jaipur Gharana developed in the courts of the Kachchwaha kings of Jaipur in Rajasthan.

- Importance is placed on the more technical aspects of dance, such as complex and powerful 
footwork, multiple spins, and complicated compositions in different talas.
- There is also a greater incorporation of compositions from the pakhawaj, such as parans.



- The Benares Gharana was developed by Janakiprasad.

- It is characterized by the exclusive use of the natwari or dance bols, which are different from 
the tabla and the pakhawaj bols.
- There are differences in the thaat and tatkaar, and chakkars are kept at a minimum but are often 
taken from both the right- and the left-hand sides with equal confidence.
- There is also a greater use of the floor, for example, in the taking of sam.

Noted Kathak exponents are: Shambhu Maharaj, Sitara Devi, Pandit Birju Maharaj

4. Manipuri

Manipuri, one of the classical dances of India, originated in Manipur, the north-eastern state of 
India.
The people of Manipur have been protected from outside influences, and

able to retain their unique traditional culture. Manipuri dance is associated with rituals and 
traditional festivals.
The cult of Radha and Krishna, particularly the raslila, is central to its themes

   
   


 

but the dances, unusually, incorporate the characteristic symbols (kartal or manjira) and 
double-headed drum (pung or Manipuri mridang) of sankirtan into the visual performance.
The most popular forms of Manipuri dance are the Ras, the Sankirtana and the Thang-Ta.

In Manipuri 7Bs, the main characters are Radha, Krishna and the gopis.The themes often depict the 
pangs
of separation of the gopis and Radha from Krishna.

The Kirtan form of congregational singing accompanies the dance which is known

as &W/z/’aze in Manipur. The male dancers play the Pung and Kartal while dancing. The masculine 
aspect of dance - the Choloms is a part of the Sankirtana tradition.
The martial dancers of Manipur - the 7Zezg•/a - have their origins in the days

when man's survival depended on his ability to defend himself from wild animals.Today, Manipur has 
an evolved and sophisticated repertoire of martial dances, the dancers use swords, spears and 
shields. Real fight scenes between the dancers show an extensive training and control of the body.
The noted exponents of Manipuri are: L Bino Devi, Darshan a Zhaveri

5. Kathakali

Kathakali has evolved from many social and religious theatrical forms of Kerala.

It is a blend of dance, music and acting and dramatizes stories, which are mostly

adapted from the Indian epics. Poet Vallathol, composed the classical Kathakali dance form.
It is a highly stylized classical Indian dance-drama noted for the attractive make-up of

characters, elaborate costumes, detailed gestures and well-defined body movements presented in tune 
with the anchor playback music and complementary percussion.

(iv) Song/vocal accompaniment (Geetha)

(v) Instrument accompaniment (Vadyam)
Noted Kathakali exponents are: Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair, Kalamandalam Gopi, Madavoor Vasudevan 
Nair

6. Odissi

Odissi, originally from Orissa, is a dance of love and passion touching on the divine and the 
human, the sublime and the mundane.
It is the c 'zdzs ' szz<  zgr zdzse form of India on the basis of archaeological evidences.
This dance is characterized by various Z sagas (Stance), which involves stamping of

the foot and striking various postures as seen in Indian sculptures. The common Bhangas are Bhanga, 
Abanga, Atibhanga and Tribhanga.
The techniques of movement are built around the two basic postures of the Chowk and the Tribhanga. 
The ct  is a position imitating a square - a very masculine stance
with the weight of the body equally balanced. The /<rZz/'z  is a very feminine stance

where the body is deflected at the neck, torso and the knees.

The Odissi tradition existed in three schools:



- Maharis were Oriya devadasis or temple girls, their name deriving from Maha (great) and Nari or 
Mahri (chosen) particularly those at the temple of Jagganath at Puri.
- Early Maharis performed mainly Nritta (pure dance) and Abhinaya (interpretation of poetry) based 
on Mantras and Slokas. Later, Maharis especially performed dance sequences based on the lyrics of 
Jayadev's Gita Govinda.


   
   


 

- Gotipuas were boys dressed up as girls and taught the dance by the Maharis.

- During this period, Vaishnava poets composed innumerable lyrics in Oriya dedicated to Radha and 
Krishna.


- Nartaki dance took place in the royal courts.

- During the British time the misuse of devadasis came under strong attack, so that Odissi dance 
withered in the temples and became unfashionable at court. Only the remnants of the Gotipua school 
remained.
Noted Odissi exponents are: Kelucharan Mohapatra, Sonal Mansingh

7. Mohiniyattam

It is a classical dance form from Kerala.

It is considered a very graceful form of dance meant to be performed as solo recitals by women.

The term Mohiniyattam comes from the words "Mohini" meaning a woman who enchants onlookers and 
"aattam" meaning graceful and sensuous
body movements. The word "Mohiniyattam" literally means "dance of the

enchantress".

There are two stories of the Lord Vishnu disguised as a Mohini. In one, he appears as Mohini to 
lure the asuras (demons) away from the amrita
(nectar of immortality) obtained during the churning of the palazhi or Ocean

of Milk. In the second story Vishnu appears as Mohini to save Lord Shiva from the demon Bhasmasura.
The dance involves the swaying of broad hips and the gentle movements of erect posture from
side to side.

This is reminiscent of the swinging of the palm leaves and the gently flowing rivers which abound 
Kerala.

There are approximately 40 basic movements, known as a/‘aiar4a/.

The vocal music of Mohiniyattam involves variations in rhythmic structure known as o z '/zz


   
   


 

Noted exponents of Mohiniyattam are: T. Chinnammu Amma, Kalamandalam Sugandhi

8. Sattriya

The Sattriya dance form was introduced in the 15th century A.D by the

great Vaishnava saint and reformer of Assam, Mahapurusha Sankaradeva as a powerful medium for 
propagation of the Vaishnava faith.
Sankaradeva introduced this dance form by incorporating different

elements from various treatises,then prevalent dance forms and local folk dances combined with his 
own rare outlook.
Sattriya dance is a clear indication of the influence of the former on the

latter. Other visible influences on Sattriya dance are those from Assamese folk dances namely Bihu,
Bodos

52. Origin of Theatre in India

fiaraI‘a’s A I‘ja ilea was the earliest and most elaborate treatise on dramaturgy written anywhere 
in the
world. India has a longest and richest tradition in theatre going back to at least 5000 years. The 
origin of Indian

theatre is closely related to ancient rituals and seasonal festivities of the country.

In Natya Shastra, Bharata Muni consolidated and codified various traditions in dance, mime and
drama. No book of

ancient times in the world contains such an exhaustive study on dramaturgy as Natya Shastra. It is
addressed to

the playwright, the director, and the actor because to Bharata Muni these three were inseparable in 
the creation of

a drama.

Hindu theorists from the earliest days conceived of plays in terms of two types of production:

1.  az sex (realistic), which involved the reproduction of human behaviour on the stage and the 
natural

presentation of objects

2. 7B/ az ez  (conventional), which is the presentation of a play through the use of stylized 
gestures and
symbolism and was considered more artistic than realistic

Theatre in India has encompassed all the other forms of literature and fine arts into its physical

and being called

’7I 'Mpa’ or Theatre in English.

10. Puppetry

In Puppet Theatre various forms, known as puppets, are used to illustrate the narratives. In India, 
the
roots of the

puppet theatre lie in a dancer's mask. Excavations at several Harappan sites have revealed a number
of toys

whose body parts can be manipulated with strings.

There are basic four kinds of puppets - glove, string, rod and shadow. The puppeteer narrates his 
story in verse or

prose, while the puppets provide the visual treat. Stories adapted from puranic literature, local 
myths and legends

usually form the content of traditional puppet theatre in India which, in turn, imbibes elements of 
all creative


   
   


 

expressions like painting, sculpture, music, dance, drama, etc. The presentation of puppet 
programmes involves

the creative efforts of many people working together.

58. String Puppets

String puppets are also called as z/s  lies. Marionettes having jointed limbs controlled by strings 
allow far

greater flexibility and are, therefore, the most articulate of the puppets. Rajasthan, Orissa, 
Karnataka and Tamil

Nadu are some of the regions where this form of puppetry has flourished.

Kathputli, Rajasthan

Carved from a single piece of wood, these puppets are like large dolls that are colourfully 
dressed.
The Kathputli is accompanied by a highly dramatised version of the regional music.

Oval faces, large eyes, arched eyebrows and large lips are some of the distinct facial features.
These puppets wear long trailing skirts and do not have legs.

Puppeteers manipulate them with two to five strings which are normally tied to their fingers and 
not to a
prop or a support.

Kundhei, Orissa

Made of light wood, the Orissa puppets have no legs but wear long flowing skirts.

They have more joints and are, therefore, more versatile, articulate and easy to manipulate.

The puppeteers often hold a wooden prop, triangular in shape, to which strings are attached for 
manipulation.
The costumes of Kundhei resemble those worn by actors of the Jatra traditional theatre.
The music is drawn from the popular tunes of the region and is sometimes influenced by the music of 
Odissi dance.

Gombeyatta, Karnataka
   
   


 

The puppets are styled and designed like the characters of Yakshagana theatre form of the region.
The Gombeyatta puppet figures are highly stylized and have joints at the legs,

shoulders, elbows, hips and knees. These puppets are manipulated by five to seven strings tied to a 
prop.
Some of the more complicated movements of the puppet are manipulated by two to three puppeteers at 
a time.
Episodes enacted in Gombeyatta are usually based on Prasangas of the Yakshagana plays.

The music that accompanies is dramatic and beautifully blends folk and classical elements.

Bommalattam, Tamil Nadu

Bommalattam combine the techniques of both rod and string puppets.

They are made of wood and the strings for manipulation are tied to an iron ring which the puppeteer 
wears like a crown on his head.
A few puppets have jointed arms and hands, which are manipulated by rods.

The Bommalattam puppets are the largest, heaviest and the most articulate of

all traditional Indian marionettes. A puppet may be as big as 4.5 feet in height weighing about ten 
kilograms.
Bommalattam theatre has elaborate preliminaries which are divided into four parts - Id'zzz a4  a,



59. Shadow Puppets

Shadow puppets are flat figures. They are cut out of leather, which has been treated to make it 
translucent.

Shadow puppets are pressed against the screen with a strong source of light behind it. The 
manipulation between

the light and the screen make silhouettes or colourful shadows for the viewers who sit in front of 
the screen. This

tradition of shadow puppets survives in Orissa, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and 
Tamil Nadu.
   
   


 

Togalu Gombeyatta, Karnataka

These puppets are mostly small in size.

The puppets however differ in size according to their social status, for instance,

large size for kings and religious characters and smaller size for common people or servants.
Tholu Bommalata, Andhra Pradesh

The puppets are large in size and have jointed waist, shoulders, elbows and knees.

They are coloured on both sides. Hence, these puppets throw coloured shadows on the screen.
The music is dominantly influenced by the classical music of the region and the

theme of the puppet plays are drawn from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas.
Ravanachhaya, Orissa

The puppets are in one piece and have no joints. Hence the manipulation requires great dexterity.
They are not coloured, hence throw opaque shadows on the screen.
The puppets are made of deer skin and are conceived in bold dramatic poses. Apart from human and 
animal characters, many props such as trees,

mountains, chariots, etc. are also used.

Although, Ravanachhaya puppets are smaller in size-the largest not more than two feet have no 
jointed
limbs, they create very sensitive and lyrical shadows.

60. Rod Puppets

Rod puppets are an extension of glove-puppets, but often much larger and supported and manipulated 
by rods

from below. This form of puppetry now is found mostly in West Bengal and Orissa.

Putul Nautch, West Bengal

   
   


 

The Puppets are carved from wood and follow the various artistic styles of a particular region.
The Bengal rod-puppets are about 3 to 4 feet in height and are costumed like the actors of Jatra 
theatre form.
These puppets have mostly three joints. The heads, supported by the main

rod, is joined at the neck and both hands attached to rods are joined at the shoulders.
A bamboo-made hub is tied firmly to the waist of the puppeteer on which the

rod holding the puppet is placed. The puppeteers each holding one puppet, stand behind a head-high

curtain and while manipulating the rods also move and dance imparting corresponding movements to 
the

puppets.

While the puppeteers themselves sing and deliver the stylized prose dialogues, a group of 
musicians,
usually three to four in numbers, sitting at the side of the stage provide the accompanying music 
with a

drum, harmonium and cymbals.

Yampuri, Bihar

These puppets are made of wood.

Unlike the traditional Rod puppets of West Bengal, these puppets are in one piece and have no 
joints.
As these puppets have no joints, the manipulation is different from other Rod puppets and requires 
greater dexterity.
61. Glove Puppets

Glove puppets are also known as sleeve, hand or palm puppets. The head is made of her  zocW,

cloth or wood, with two hands emerging from just below the neck. The rest of the figure consists of 
a long flowing

skirt. The manipulation technique is simple. The movements are controlled by the human hand with 
the first finger
   
   


 

inserted in the head and the middle finger and the thumb are the two arms of the puppet. The 
tradition of glove

puppets in India is popular in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Kerala.

Pavakoothu, Kerala

It came into existence during the 18th century due to the influence of Kathakali.

In Pavakoothu, the height of a puppet varies from one foot to two feet. The

head and the arms are carved of wood and joined together with thick cloth, cut and stitched into a 
small bag. The face of the puppet is decorated with paints, small and thin pieces of gilded tin, 
the feathers of the peacock, etc.
The musical instruments used during the performance are Chenda, Chengiloa, Ilathalam and Shankha.

The theme for Glove puppet plays in Kerala is based on the episodes from either the Ramayana or the
Mahabharata.

13. UNESCO Intangible Heritage Lists
The Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage are established by UNESCO aiming to ensure the better
protection of
important intangible cultural heritages worldwide and the awareness of their significance.
Cultural heritage does not end at monuments and collections of objects. It also includes traditions 
or living
expressions inherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants. Intangible cultural 
heritage is an
important factor in maintaining cultural diversity in the face of growing globalization.
In 2008, the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage came into 
effect. It
identified five broad ‘domains’ in which intangible cultural heritage is manifested:
(i) Oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural 
heritage;
(ii) Performing arts;
(iii) Social practices, rituals and festive events;
(iv) Knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe;
(v) Traditional craftsmanship.
The programme currently compiles two lists:
1) The 7d' eserz'a/? ze ZYs/’ of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity comprises cultural 
"practices and
expressions [that] help demonstrate the diversity of this heritage and raise awareness about its 
importance." This is the longer of the two lists.
2) The List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 7\éed' & V¿;ezz’ &/zg;zazz zg’ is composed of those 
cultural
elements that concerned communities and countries consider require urgent measures to keep them
alive.
Inscriptions on this List help mobilize international cooperation and assistance for stakeholders 
to undertake appropriate measures.
Prior to this, a project known as the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity 
had already been
active in recognizing the value of intangibles through a Proclamation. Started in 2001, 90 forms of 
intangible
heritage around the world were recognized. The 90 previously proclaimed Masterpieces have been
incorporated
into the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Subsequent elements 
were added
following the assessment of nominations submitted by member states. A panel of experts in 
intangible heritage and
an appointed body, known as the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible 
Cultural
Heritage, then examine each of the nominations before officially inscribing the candidates as 
elements on the List.
Currently no cultural heritage items of India are listed in the "List of Intangible Cultural 
Heritage in need of Urgent
Safeguarding".
Eight items from India were listed as Masterpieces and now included in the Representative List. 
These are:
Chhau Dance, Eastern India (three distinct styles hail from Seraikilla, Purulia and Mayurbhanj) 
Kalbelia folk songs and dances of Rajasthan
Mudiyettu, ritual theatre and dance form of Kerala
Navroz, Parsi new year festivity. It is celebrated on 21 March every year, a date originally 
determined by
astronomical calculations. Novruz is associated with various local traditions, such as the 
evocation of Jamshid, a mythological king of Iran, and numerous tales and legends.
Ramman, religious festival and ritual theatre of Garhwal hills (Chamoli, Uttarakhand) Kutiyattam,
