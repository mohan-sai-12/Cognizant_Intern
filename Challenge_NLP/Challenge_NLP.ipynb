Instrument to conquer Indian powers\\n\\n2. Defended the British Empire in India against foreign rivals\\n\\n3. Safe-guarded against internal revolt\\n\\n4. Chief instrument for extending and defending the British Empire in Asia and Africa.\\n\\nBulk of the army consisted of Indians. In 1857, of the total strength of 311400, about 265900 were \\nIndians. Highest Indian rank was that of Subedar.\\n\\nBritish could conquer and control India through a predominantly Indian army because:\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n1. There was absence of modern nationalism at that time\\n\\n2. The company paid its soldiers regularly and well, as opposed to the Indian rulers and \\nchieftains.\\n\\nPolice\\nCornwallis was responsible for the creation of a modern police system in India. He established a \\nsystem of Thanas (or circles) headed by a daroga. The police:\\n1. Prevented organization of a large-scale conspiracy against foreign control\\n\\n2. Was used to suppress the national movement.\\n\\nJudiciary\\nThough started by Hastings, the system was stabilized by Cornwallis. Civil Cases\\nDistrict: Diwani Adalat (civil court) presided over by the District Judge Provincial Court: Appeal \\nfrom civil court\\nSardar Diwani Adalat: Highest appeal\\n\\nThere were also, below the District Court, Registrar\\'s Court (headed by Europeans) and subordinate \\ncourts headed by Indians known as munsifs or amins.\\n\\nCriminal Cases\\n\\n4 divisions of Bengal presidency.

In 1865, High Courts were \\nestablished at Madras, Calcutta and Bombay.\\nBritish brought about uniformity in the system of law. In 1833, the government appointed Law \\nCommission headed by Macaulay to codify Indian Laws. This eventually resulted in the Indian Penal \\nCode, Code of Civil and Criminal Procedures and other codes of laws.\\nSpread of Modern Education\\n1781: Hastings set up the Calcutta Madrasah for the study and teaching of Muslim law and related \\nsubjects\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n1791: Jonathan Duncan started a Sanskrit College at Varanasi for the study of Hindu law and \\nphilosophy.\\n\\n1813: Charter of 1813 directed the Company to spend Rs. 1 lakh for promoting modern sciences in the \\ncountry. This sum was however made available only in 1823.\\n\\n1835: Macaulay\\'s minute.\\n\\nEnglish was made the medium of instruction in schools. Education of masses was however neglected. \\nBritish advocated the ’downward filtration theory’ for education. As per this theory, since the \\nallocated funds could educate only a handful of Indians, it was decided to spend them in educating \\na few persons from the upper and middle classes who were expected to assume the task of educating \\nthe masses and spreading modern ideas among them.\\n1844: Compulsion for applicants for government employment to possess knowledge of English. This \\nmade the English medium schools more popular.\\n\\n1854: Wood\\'s Dispatch asked the government of India to assume responsibility for the education of \\nthe masses. It thus repudiated the ’downward filtration theory’. As a result, Departments of \\nEducation were instituted in all provinces and universities were setup in 1857 at Madras, Calcutta \\nand Bombay.\\n\\nThe main reason why British adopted some measures towards education in India was because:\\n\\n1. They needed educated people to man their system of administration. It was not possible to get \\nenough Englishmen to man all the posts.\\n2. Another important motive was the belief that educated Indians would help expand the market for \\nBritish manufactures in India.\\n\\n3.  Lastly, it was expected to reconcile the people of India to British rule. Major drawbacks of \\nthe English education system:\\n1. Neglect of mass education. Mass literacy in India was hardly better in 1921 than in 1821. High \\nfees in schools and colleges led to the education becoming a monopoly of the rich.\\n2. Almost total neglect of the education of girls. As late as 1921 only 2 percent Indian women \\ncould read and write.\\n3. Neglect of scientific and technical education.\\n\\n4. The government was never willing to spend more than a scanty sum on education.\\n\\nDevelopment of Education\\n\\n\\n• Charter act of 1813\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\no Sanctioned 1 lakh rupees annually for promoting education and modern sciences\\no Not made available till 1823\\n•  Orientalist-Anglicist Controversy\\n• Lord Macaulay\\'s minute (1835)\\n• Wood\\'s Despatch (1854)\\no Rejected the downward filtration theory\\na  Asked the government of India to assume the responsibility of education of the masses\\no English as medium for higher studies and vernaculars at school level\\n• 1857: University of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras\\n• Hunter Commission (1882-83)\\no State care required for promotion and spread of primary and secondary education\\no Transfer control of primary education to district and municipal boards\\n• Raleigh Commission, 1902\\n• Universities Act 1904\\n• Saddler Education Commission (1917-19)\\no School course should cover 12 years\\na  Less rigidity in framing university regulations\\n• Hartog Committee (1929)\\no No hasty expansion or compulsion of education\\n• Wardha Scheme of basic education (1937)\\no Vocation based education\\no Social and Cultural Awakening\\n\\n\\nSocial and Cultural Awakening\\n\\nRaja Rammohan Roy:\\n\\nRRM Roy was a social reformer and intellectual in the early nineteenth century Bengal.

The Meerut incident. Capture of Delhi.

Sikh regiment as well remained largely loyal.\\n\\nCauses for the revolt\\nThe revolt was a result of the accumulated grievances of the people against Company\\'s \\nadministration and a loathing for the character and policies of the colonial rule. The causes can \\nbe classified as social, economic, religious and military. <In class notes>\\n\\nWHY DID THE SEPOYS REVOLT?\\n\\n—  The conditions of service in the Company\\'s army and cantonments increasingly came into conflict \\nwith the religious beliefs and prejudices of the sepoys.\\n\\nThe unhappiness of the sepoys first surfaced in 1824 when the 47*ʰ Regiment of Barrackpur was \\nordered to go to Burma. To the religious Hindu, crossing the sea meant loss of caste. The sepoys \\nrefused. The regiment was disbanded and those who led the opposition were hanged.\\n\\nThe rumors about the Government\\'s secret designs to promote conversions to Christianity further \\nexasperated the sepoys.\\n\\nThe greased cartridges\\n\\nThey were also unhappy with the emoluments\\n\\n— Discrimination and racism\\n\\n—  Misery brought to the peasants by the British rule. E.g. the land revenue system imposed in \\nOudh, where about 75000 sepoys came from, was very harsh.\\n\\n— The civilians also participated\\n\\nAfter the capture of Delhi, a letter was issued to the neighboring states asking for support.\\n\\nA court of administrators was established in Delhi\\n\\nIII-equipped, the rebels carried on the struggle for about a year\\n\\n—  The country as a whole was not behind them. The merchants, intelligentsia and Indian rulers not \\nonly kept aloof but actively supported the British.\\n\\nAlmost half the Indian soldiers not only did not revolt but fought against their own countrymen.\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nApart from a commonly shared hatred for alien rule, the rebels had no political perspective or \\ndefinite vision of the future\\n\\nDelhi fell on September 20, 1857.\\n\\nRani of Jhansi died fighting on June 17, 1858\\n\\n— Nana Saheb escaped to Nepal hoping to revive the struggle.\\n\\nKunwar Singh died on May 9, 1958\\n\\nTantia tope carried on guerrilla warfare until April 1959 after which he was betrayed by a \\nzamindar, captured and put to death.\\n\\nImportant Persons relating to the Revolt\\n\\nBahadur Shah Zafar: BSZ was the last Mughal emperor of India. Nana Saheb\\nRani Lakshmi Bai\\n\\nKunwar Singh\\n\\nNawab Wajid Ali Shah\\n\\nBirjis Qadr: The son of Wajid Ali Shah and the leader of the revolt in Lucknow.\\n\\nShah Mal: He belonged to a clan of Jat cultivators in parganan Barout in UP. During the revolt, he \\nmobilized the headmen and cultivators of chaurasee des (84 villages: his kinship area), moving at \\nnight from village to village, urging people to rebel against the British.\\n\\nMaulvi Ahmadullah Shah: Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah was one of the many maulvis who played an important \\npart in the revolt of 1857. 1856, he was seen moving from village to village preaching jehad \\n(religious war) against the British and urging people to rebel. he was elected by the mutinous 22nd \\nNative Infantry as their leader. He fought in the famous Battle of Chinhat in which the British \\nforces under Henry Lawrence were defeated.\\n\\nBegum Hazrat Mahal:\\n\\n\\nChapter 2: Civil Rebellions and Tribal Uprisings\\n\\nThe backbone of the rebellions, their mass base and striking power came from the rack- rented \\npeasants, ruined artisans and demobilized soldiers\\nCAUSES\\n\\nThe major cause of the civil rebellions was the rapid changes the British introduced in the \\neconomy, administration and land revenue system.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe revenues were enhanced by increasing taxes.\\n\\nThousands of zamindars and poligars lost control over their land and its revenue either due to the \\nextinction of their rights by the colonial state or by the forced sale of their rights over land \\nbecause of their inability to meet the exorbitant land revenue demanded.\\n\\nThe economic decline of the peasantry was reflected in twelve major and numerous minor famines from \\n1770 to 1857\\n\\nThe new courts and legal system gave a further fillip to the dispossessors of land and encouraged \\nthe rich to oppress the poor.\\n\\nThe police looted, oppressed and tortured the common people at will. The ruin of Indian handicraft \\nindustries pauperized millions of artisans\\nThe scholarly and priestly classes were also active in inciting hatred and rebellion against \\nforeign rule.\\n\\nVery foreign character of the British rule REBELLIONS\\n— From 1763 to 1856, there were more than forty major rebellions apart from hundreds of minor ones.\\n\\nSanyasi Rebellion: (1763-1800)\\n\\nChuar uprising (1766-1772 6‹ 1795-1816); Rangpur and Dinajpur (1783); Bishnupur and Birbhum (1799); \\nOrissa zamindars (1804-17) and Sambalpur (1827-40) and many others\\nWHY FAILED?\\n\\nThese rebellions were local in their spread and were isolated from each other.\\n\\nThey were the result of local causes and grievances, and were also localized in their effects.\\n\\nSocially, economically and politically, the semi-feudal leaders of these rebellions were backward \\nlooking and traditional in outlook.\\n\\nThe suppression of the civil rebellions was a major reason why the revolt of 1857 did not spread to \\nSouth India and most of Eastern and Western India.\\nTRIBAL UPRISINGS: CAUSES\\n\\nThe colonial administrators ended their relative isolation and brought them fully within the ambit \\nof colonialism.\\n\\nIntroduced new system of land revenue and taxation of tribal products\\n\\n— Influx of Christian missionaries into the tribal areas They could no longer practice shifting \\nagriculture\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nOppression and extortion by police officials\\n\\nThe complete disruption of the old agrarian order of the tribal communities provided the common \\nfactor for all the tribal uprisings\\nUPRISINGS\\n\\nSanthals\\n\\n— Kols of Chhotanagpur (1820-37) Birsa Munda (1899-1900)\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3: Peasant Uprisings\\n\\nMany dispossessed peasants took to robbery and dacoity. Indigo Revolt of 1859-60\\nBy the end of 1860 indigo cultivation was virtually wiped out from the districts of Bengal\\n\\nA major reason for the success of the Indigo revolt was the tremendous initiative, cooperation, \\norganization and discipline of the ryots.\\n\\nAnother was the complete unity among Hindu and Muslim peasants\\n\\nAnother significant feature was the role of intelligentsia of Bengal which organized a powerful \\ncampaign in support of the rebellious peasantry.\\n\\nThe government\\'s response to the revolt was rather restrained and not as harsh as in the case of \\ncivil rebellions and tribal uprisings.\\n\\nThe government appointed the Indigo Commission to enquire into the problems of indigo cultivation. \\nThe report of the commission exposed the coercion and corruption in indigo cultivation\\n\\nThe government issued a notification in November 1960 that ryots could not be compelled to sow \\nindigo and all disputes were to be settled by legal means.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4 & 5\\n\\nWhy did national movement arise?\\n\\n• Indian nationalism rose to meet the challenges of foreign domination\\n•  The British rule and its direct and indirect consequences provided the material and the moral \\nand intellectual conditions for the development of a national movement in India.\\n• Clash of interest between the interests of the Indian people with British interests in India\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  Increasingly, the British rule became the major cause of India\\'s economic backwardness\\n•  Every class gradually discovered that their interests were suffering at the hands of the British \\no  Peasant: Govt took a large part of produce away as land revenue. Laws favoured the\\nZamindars\\no Artisans: Foreign competition ruined the industry\\no Workers: The government sided with the capitalists\\no  Intelligentsia: They found that the British policies were guided by the interests of British \\ncapitalists and were keeping the country economically backward. Politically, the British had no \\ncommitment of guiding India towards self-government.\\na  Indian capitalists: the growth of Indian industries was constrained by the unfavourable trade, \\ntariff, taxation and transport policies of the government.\\na  Zamindars, landlords and princes were the only ones whose interests coincided with those of the \\nBritish. Hence they remained loyal to them.\\n•  Hence, it was the intrinsic nature of foreign imperialism and its harmful effect on the lives of \\nthe Indian people that led to the rise of the national movement. This movement could be called the \\nnational movement because it united people from different parts of the country as never before for \\na single cause.\\n\\nWhat factors strengthened and facilitated the national movement?\\n•  Administration and Economic Unification of the country\\no  Introduction of modern trade and industries on all-lndia scale had increasingly made India\\'s \\neconomic life a single whole and interlinked the economic fate of people living in different parts \\nof the country.\\no Introduction of railways, telegraph and unified postal system brought together different parts of \\nthe country and promoted contact among people like never before.\\na  This unification led to the emergence of the Indian nation\\n• Western Thought and Education\\na  A large number of Indians imbibed a modern rational, secular, democratic and nationalist \\npolitical outlook\\na  They began to study, admire and emulate the contemporary nationalist movements of European \\nnations\\na  The western education per se did not create the national movement. It only enabled the educated \\nIndians to imbibe western thought and thus to assume the leadership of the national movement and to \\ngive it a democratic and modern direction\\no Modern education created a certain uniformity and community of outlook and interests among the \\neducation Indians.\\n• Role of Press and Literature\\no Large number of nationalist newspapers appeared in the second half of the 19ᵗʰ century\\no They criticized the policies of the British government and put forth the Indian point of view\\no National literature in form of essays, novels and poetry also played an important role. Bamkin \\nChandra, Tagore: Bengali; Bhartendu Harishchandra: Hindi; Lakshmikanth Bezbarua: Assamese; Vishnu \\nShastri Chiplunkar: Marathi; Subramanya Bharti: Tamil; Altaf Husain Hali: Urdu\\n• Rediscovery of India\\'s past\\na  The British had lowered the self confidence of the Indian through the propaganda that Indians \\nare incapable of self-government\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\no Nationalist leaders referred to the cultural heritage of India to counter this propaganda. They \\nreferred to political achievements of rulers like Ashoka, Chandragupta Vikramaditya and Akbar.\\na However, some nationalists went to the extent of glorifying the past uncritically.\\nThey emphasized on the achievements of ancient India and not medieval India. This encouraged the \\ngrowth of communal sentiments.\\n• Racial arrogance of the rulers\\na  Englishmen adopted a tone of racial superiority in their dealings with the Indians\\no Failure of justice whenever an Englishman was involved in a dispute with an Indian. a  Indians \\nkept out of European clubs and often were not permitted to travel in same\\ncompartment as Englishmen\\n\\nRise of Indian National Congress\\n\\nPredecessors of INC\\n•  East India Association\\no By Dadabhai Naoroji in 1866 in London\\no To discuss the Indian question and to influence the British public men to discuss Indian welfare\\no Branches of the association in prominent Indian cities\\n•  Indian Association\\no Surendranath Banerjee and Ananda Mohan Bose in 1876, Calcutta\\no The aim of creating strong public opinion in the country on political questions and the \\nunification of the Indian people on a common political programme\\n•  Poona Sarvajanik Sabha\\no Justice Ranade, 1870\\n•  Madras Mahajan Sabha\\no Viraraghavachari, Anand Charloo, G Subramanian Aiyer, 1884\\n•  Bombay Presidency Association\\no Pherozshah Mehta, K T Telang, Badruddin Tyabji, 1885\\n•  These organizations were narrow in their scope and functioning. They dealt mostly with local \\nquestions and their membership were confined to a few people belonging to a single city or province\\n\\nIndian National Congress\\n•  Indian National Congress was founded on 28 December 1885 by 72 political workers. A 0 Hume was \\nthe first secretary and was instrumental in establishing the Congress\\n•  First session in Bombay. President: W C Bonnerjee\\n•  With the formation of INC, the Indian National Movement was launched in a small but organized \\nmanner\\n•  The Congress itself was to serve not as a party but as a movement\\n•  Congress was democratic. The delegates to INC were elected by different local organizations and \\ngroups\\n•  Sovereignty of the people\\n• In 1890, Kadambini Ganguli, the first woman graduate of Calcutta University addressed the \\nCongress session\\n• Safety Valve Theory\\no  The INC was started under the official direction, guidance and advice of Lord Dufferin, the \\nViceroy, to provide a safe, mild, peaceful and constitutional outlet or\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nsafety valve for the rising discontent among the masses, which was inevitably leading towards a \\npopular and violent revolution.\\nDoes the safety valve theory explain the formation of Congress?\\n•  The safety valve theory is inadequate and misleading\\n•  INC represented the urge of the Indian educated class to set up a national organization to work \\nfor their political and economic development\\n•  A number of organizations, as mentioned above, had already been started by the Indians towards \\nthat end\\n• Hume\\'s presence in Congress was used to allay official suspicions\\n\\n\\nWhy was there a need for an All-India organization?\\n• Vernacular Press Act, 1878\\n•  Ilbert Bill (1883) which would allow Indian judges to try Europeans was opposed by the European \\ncommunity and was finally enacted in a highly compromised state in 1884.\\n•  The Indians realized that they could not get the Ilbert bill passed because they were not united \\non all India level. Hence need for INC was felt.\\n•  In order to give birth to the national movement\\no Creation of national leadership was important a  Collective identification was created\\n\\nAims of INC\\n•  Promotion of friendly relations between nationalist political workers from different parts of\\nthe country\\n• Development and consolidation of the feeling of national unity irrespective of caste, religion or \\nprovince\\n• Formulation of popular demands and their presentation before the government\\n•  Training and organization of public opinion in the country\\n\\n\\n—  The first major objective of the Indian national movement was to promote weld Indians into a \\nnation, to create an Indian identity\\n\\nFuller development and consolidation of sentiments of national unity\\no  Efforts for unity: In an effort to reach all regions, it was decided to rotate the congress \\nsession among different parts of the country. The President was to belong to a region other than \\nwhere the congress session was being held.\\n\\no  To reach out to the followers of all religions and to remove the fears of the minorities, a rule \\nwas made at the 1888 session that no resolution was to be passed to which an overwhelming majority \\nof Hindu or Muslim delegates objected.\\n\\no  In 1889, a minority clause was adopted in the resolution demanding reform of legislative \\ncouncils. According to the clause, wherever Parsis, Christians, Muslims or Hindus were a minority \\ntheir number elected to the councils would not be less than their proportion in the population.\\no To build a secular nation, the congress itself had to be intensely secular\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe second major objective of the early congress was to create a common political platform or \\nprogramme around which political workers in different parts of the country could gather and conduct \\ntheir political activities.\\no Due to its focus solely on political issues congress did not take up the question of\\nsocial reform.\\n\\nSince this form of political participation was new to India, the arousal, training, organization \\nand consolidation of public opinion was seen as a major task by the congress leaders.\\n\\no Going beyond the redressal of immediate grievances and organize sustained political activity.\\nContribution of early nationalists\\n•  Early nationalists believed that a direct struggle for the political emancipation of the country \\nwas not yet on the agenda of history. On agenda was:\\no Creation of public interest in political questions and the organization of public opinion\\no Popular demands had to be formulated on a country-wide basis\\no National unity had to be created. Indian nationhood had to be carefully promoted.\\n•  Early national leaders did not organize mass movement against the British. But they did carry \\nout an ideological struggle against them. (Important from a Gramscian perspective)\\n\\n• Economic critique of imperialism\\no Economic critique of imperialism was the most important contribution of the early nationalists\\no They recognized that the essence of British economic imperialism lay in the subordination of the \\nIndian economy to the British economy\\no They complained of India\\'s growing poverty and economic backwardness and the failure of modern \\nindustry and agriculture to grow\\no They wanted the government to promote modern industries through tariff protection and direct \\ngovernment aid\\na  Popularized the idea of swadeshi and the boycott of British goods\\no  They propounded the ‘drain of wealth’ theory and demanded that this drain be stopped\\no Demanded reduction of taxes and land revenue a  Condemned the high military expenditure\\n•  Constitutional reforms\\na  They were extremely cautious. From 1885 to 1892 they demanded the expansion and reform of the \\nLegislative Councils\\no Due to their demands, the British passed the Indian Councils Act of 1892\\no They failed to broaden the base of their democratic demands. Did not demand the right to vote for \\nthe masses or for women\\n•  Administrative and other reforms\\no  They demanded Indianisation of the higher grades of the administrative services.\\no  They had economic political reasons for this. Economically, appointment of British only to ICS \\nmade Indian administration costly because they were paid very high. Politically, appointment of \\nIndians would make the administration more responsive to Indian needs\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\no Demanded separation of the judicial from executive powers so that the people might get some \\nprotection from the arbitrary acts of the police and the bureaucracy.\\no Urged the government to undertake and develop welfare activities and education\\n• Defense of Civil Rights Methods of work of early nationalists\\n• Dominated by moderates till 1905\\n•  Method of moderates: Constitutional agitation within the four walls of the law, and slow, \\norderly political progress. Their work had two pronged direction:\\no  To build a strong public opinion in India to arouse the political consciousness and national \\nspirit of the people, and to educate and unite them on political questions\\no They wanted to persuade the British government and British public opinion to introduce reforms \\nalong directions laid down by the nationalists.\\n•  In 1889, a British Committee of the INC was founded. In 1890 this committee started a journal \\ncalled India.\\nWhat about the role of the masses?\\n• The basic weakness of the early national movement lay in its narrow social base.\\n•  The leaders lacked political faith in the masses.\\n• Hence, masses were assigned a passive role in the early phase of the national movement.\\nEvaluation\\n\\n•  The basic objectives of the early nationalist leaders were to lay the foundations of a secular \\nand democratic national movement, to politicize and politically educate the people, to form the \\nheadquarters of the movement, that is, to form an all-India leadership group, and to develop and \\npropagate an anti-colonial nationalist ideology.\\n•  Very few of the reforms for which the nationalists agitated were introduced by the government\\n•  It succeeded in creating a wide national awakening and arousing the feeling of nationhood. It \\nmade the people conscious of the bonds of common political, economic and social interests and the \\nexistence of a common enemy in imperialism\\n• They exposed the true character of the British rule through their economic critique.\\n• All this was to become a base for the national movement in the later period. WHY HUME?\\n—  The leaders assumed that the rulers would be less suspicious and less likely to attack a\\npotentially subversive organization if its chief organizer was a retired British civil servant.\\n\\nGokhale himself stated explicitly in 1913 that if any Indian had started such a movement the \\nofficials wouldn\\'t have let it happen.\\nCHAPTER 6: Socio-religious reforms\\n\\nThe socio-religious reforms are also referred to as the Indian renaissance\\n\\nThe socio-cultural regeneration in nineteenth century India was occasioned by the colonial \\npresence, but not created by it.\\n\\nFormation of the Brahmo Samaj in 1828.\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nParamhansa Mandali, Prathna Samaj, Arya Samaj, Kayasth Sabha: UP, Sarin Sabha: Punjab, Satya Sodhak \\nSamaj: Maharashtra, Sri Narayana Dharma Paripalana Sabha: Kerala\\n\\nAhmadiya and Aligarh Movements: Muslims, Singh Sabha: Sikhs, Rehnumai Mazdeyasan Sabha: Parsees\\n\\nTheir attention was focused on worldly existence.\\n\\nThe idea of otherworldliness and salvation were not a part of their agenda.\\n\\n— At that time the influence of religion and superstition was overwhel ming. Position of priests \\nstrong; that of women weak.\\n\\nCaste was another debilitating factor\\n\\nNeither a revival of the past nor a total break with tradition was contemplated. Rationalism and \\nreligious universalism influenced the reform movement.\\nDevelopment of universalistic perspective on religion\\n\\nLex Loci Act propsed in 1845 and passed in 1850 provided the right to inherit ancestral property to \\nHindu converts to Christianity.\\n\\nThe culture faced a threat from the colonial rule. CHAPTER 7\\nFirst, the Indian intellectuals co-operated with the British in the hope that British would help \\nmodernize India.\\n\\nHowever, the reality of social development in India failed to conform to their hopes. Three people \\nwho carried out the economic analysis of British India:\\nO  Dadabhai Naoroji: the grand old man of India. Born in 1825, he became a successful businessman \\nbut devoted his entire life and wealth to the creation of national movement in India\\n\\nO  Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade: He taught an entire generation of Indians the value of modern \\nindustrial development.\\n\\nO  Romesh Chandra Dutt: a retired ICS officer, published The Economic History of India at the \\nbeginning of the 20\\'ʰ century in which he examined in minute detail the entire economic record of \\ncolonial rule since 1757.\\n\\nThey concluded that colonialism was the main obstacle to India\\'s economic development. Three \\naspects of domination of British: trade, industry, finance\\nThe problem of poverty was seen as a problem of national development. This approach made poverty a \\nbroad national issue and helped to unite, instead of divide, different regions and sections of \\nIndian society.\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe early nationalists accepted that the complete economic transformation of the country on the \\nbasis of modern technology and capitalist enterprise was the primary goal of their economic \\npolicies.\\n\\nBecause their whole-ted devotion to the cause of industrialization, the early nationalists looked \\nupon all other issues such as foreign trade, railways, tariffs, finance and labour legislations in \\nrelation to this paramount aspect. (and hence the obsession of Nehru with industrialization)\\n\\nHowever great the need of India for industrialization, it had to be based on Indian capital and not \\nforeign capital.\\n\\nThe early nationalists saw foreign capital as an unmitigated evil which did not develop a country \\nbut exploited and impoverished it.\\n\\nExpenditure on railways could be seen as Indian subsidy to British industries.\\n\\nA major obstacle in the process of industrial development was the policy of free trade High \\nexpenditure on the army\\nDrain theory was the focal point of nationalist critique of colonialism.\\n\\nA large part of India\\'a capital and wealth was being transferred or drained to Britain in the form \\nof salaries and pensions of British civil and military officials working in India, interest on \\nloans taken by the Indian government, profits of British capitalists in India, and the Home Charges \\nor expenses of the Indian Government in Britain.\\n\\n— This drain amounted to one-half of government revenues, more than the entire land revenue \\ncollection, and over one-third of India\\'s total savings.\\n\\n—  The Drain theory was put forward by Dadabhai Naoroji. He declared that the drain was the basic \\ncause of India\\'s poverty.\\n\\n— Through the drain theory, the exploitative character of the British rule was made visible.\\n\\n—  The drain theory possessed the merit of being easily grasped and understood by a nation of \\npeasants. No idea could arouse people more than the thought that they were being taxed so that \\nothers in far off lands might live in comfort.\\n\\nThis agitation on economic issues contributed to the undermining of the ideological hegemony of the \\nalien rulers over Indian minds.\\n\\nThe nationalist economic agitation undermined the moral foundations inculcated by the British that \\nforeign rule is beneficial for India.\\nCHAPTER 8: Freedom of Press\\n\\n•  On 29ᵗʰ January 1780, the Hickey\\'s Bengal Gazette or the Calcutta General Advertizer was \\npublished. It was the first English newspaper to be printed in the Indian sub-continent.\\n• The press was the chief instrument of forming a nationalist ideology\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  The resolutions and proceedings of the Congress were propagated through press. Trivia: nearly \\none third of the founding fathers of congress in 1885 were journalists.\\n\\n\\n• Main news papers and editors\\n\\n\\no The Hindu and Swadesamitran: G Subramaniya lyer\\no Kesari and Mahratta: BG Tilak\\no Bengalee: S N Banerjea\\no Amrita Bazar Patrika: Sisir Kumar Ghosh and Motilal Ghosh\\no Sudharak: GK Gokhale a  Indian Mirror: N N Sen\\no Voice of India: Dadabhai Naoroji\\na  Hindustani and Advocate: GP Varma\\no Tribune and Akhbar-i-Am in Punjab\\na  Indu Prakash, Dnyan Prakahs, Kal and Gujarati in Bombay\\no Som Prakash, Banganivasi and Sadharani in Bengal\\n\\n\\n•  Newspaper was not confined to the literates. It would reach the villages and would be read by a \\nreader to tens of others.\\n• Reading and discussing newspaper became a form of political participation.\\n• Nearly all the major political controversies of the day were conducted through the Press.\\n•  ’Oppose, oppose, oppose’ was the motto of the Indian press.\\n• The section 124A of the IPC was such as to punish a person who evoked feelings of disaffection to \\nthe government.\\n•  The Indian journalists remained outside 124A by adopting methods such as quoting the socialist \\nand anti-imperialist newspapers of England or letters from radical British citizens\\n•  The increasing influence of the newspapers led the government to pass the Vernacular Press Act \\nof 1978, directed only against Indian language newspapers.\\no It was passed very secretively\\no  The act provided for the confiscation of the printing press, paper and other materials of a \\nnewspaper if the government believed that it was publishing seditious materials and had flouted an \\nofficial warning.\\na  Due to the agitations, it was repealed in 1881 by Lord Ripon.\\n•  SN Banerjee was the first Indian to go to jail in performance of his duty as a journalist.\\n\\n\\nB G Tilak\\n\\n\\n\\n•  The man who is most frequently associated with the struggle for the freedom of Press during the \\nnationalist movement is Bal Gangadhar Tilak.\\n• In 1881, along with G G Agarkar, he founded the newspapers Kesari and Mahratta.\\n•  In 1893, he started the practice of using the traditional religious Ganapati festival to \\npropagate nationalist ideas through patriotic songs and speeches.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  In 1896, he started the Shivaji festival to stimulate nationalism among young Maharashtrians.\\n• He brought peasants and farmers into the national movement.\\n• He organized a no-tax campaign in Maharashtra in 1896-97\\n• Plague in Poona in 1897.\\n•  Popular resentment against the official plague measures resulted in the assassination of Rand, \\nthe Chairman of the Plague Committee in Poona, and Lt. Ayerst by the Chaphekar brothers on 27 June \\n1898.\\n•  Since 1894, anger had been rising against the government due to the tariff, currency and famine \\npolicy.\\n•  Tilak was arrested and sentenced to 18 month rigorous imprisonment in 1897. This led to country \\nwide protests and Tilak was given the title of Lokmanya.\\n•  Tilak was again arrested and tried on 24 June 1908 on the charge of sedition under article 124A. \\nHe was sentenced to 6 years of transportation. This led to nationwide protests and closing down of \\nmarkets for a week. Later, in 1922 Gandhi was tried on the same act and he said that he is proud to \\nbe associated with Tilak\\'s name.\\n\\n\\nCHAPER 9\\n\\n\\n\\n•  The Indian Councils Act of 1861 enlarged the Governor-General’s Executive Council for the \\npurpose of making laws.\\n•  The GG could add 6-12 members to the Executive Council. This came to be known as the Imperial \\nLegislative Council. It didn\\'t have any powers.\\n•  ‘Despotism controlled from home\\' was the fundamental feature of British rule in India.\\n•  The Indians nominated to the council were not representative of the nationalist movement.\\n•  Despite the early nationalists believing that India should eventually become self-governing, \\nthey moved very cautiously in putting forward political demands regarding the structure of the \\nstate, for they were afraid of the Government declaring their activities seditious and disloyal and \\nsuppressing them.\\n•  Till 1892, they only demanded reforms in the council.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10: The Swadeshi Movement: 1903-1908\\n\\nNationalist Movement 1905-1918\\nReasons for the growth of militant nationalism (this is different from revolutionary terrorism)\\n\\nDisillusionment of the nationalists with moderate policies\\n•  The moderates thought that the British could be reformed from within\\n•  Politically conscious Indians were convinced that the purpose of the British rule was to exploit \\nIndia economically\\n•  The nationalists realized that Indian industries could not flourish except under an Indian \\ngovernment\\n• Disastrous famines from 1896 to 1900 took a toll of over 90 lakh lives\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  The Indian Councils Act of 1892 was a disappointment\\n•  The Natu brothers were deported in 1897 without trial\\n•  In 1897 B G Tilak was sentenced to long term imprisonment for arousing the people against the \\ngovernment\\n• In 1904, the Indian Official Secrets Act was passed restricting the freedom of the Press\\n• Primary and technical education was not making any progress\\n•  Thus, increasing number of Indians were getting convinced that self-government was essential for \\nthe sake of economic, political and cultural progress of the country\\n\\nGrowth of Self-respect and self-confidence\\n•  Tilak, Aurobindo and Pal preached the message of self-respect\\n•  They said to the people that remedy to their condition lay in their own hand and they should \\ntherefore become strong\\n•  Swami Vivekananda\\'s messages Growth of education and unemployment\\nInternational Influences\\n• Rise of modern Japan after 1868\\n•  Defeat of the Italian army by the Ethiopians in 1896 and of Russia by Japan in 1905 exploded the \\nmyth of European superiority\\nExistence of a Militant Nationalist School of Thought Partition of Bengal\\n• With the partition of Bengal, Indian National Movement entered its second stage\\n•  On 20 July, 1905, Lord Curzon issued an order dividing the province of Bengal into two parts: \\nEastern Bengal and Assam with a population of 31 mn and the rest of Bengal with a population of 54 \\nmn.\\n• Reason given: the existing province of Bengal was too big to be efficiently administered by a \\nsingle provincial government\\n\\n• The partition expected to weaken the nerve centre of Indian Nationalism, Bengal.\\n\\n•  The partition of the state intended to curb Bengali influence by not only placing Bengalis under \\ntwo administrations but by reducing them to a minority in Bengal itself as in the new proposed \\nBengal proper was to have seventeen million Bengali and thirty seven million Oriya and Hindi \\nspeaking people.\\n\\n•  The partition was also meant to foster division on the basis of religion.\\n\\n•  Risley, Home Secretary to the Gol, said on December 6, 1904 — ‘one of our main objects is to \\nsplit up and thereby weaken a solid body of opponents to our rule.’\\n\\n•  the nationalists saw it as a deliberate attempt to divide the Bengalis territorially and on \\nreligious grounds\\n\\nThe Swadeshi Movement\\n•  The Swadeshi movement had its genesis in the anti-partition movement which was started to oppose \\nthe British decision to partition Bengal.\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n• Mass protests were organized in opposition to the proposed partition.\\n\\n• Despite the protests, the decision to partition Bengal was announced on July 19, 1905\\n\\n•  It became obvious to the nationalists that their moderate methods were not working and that a \\ndifferent kind of strategy was needed.\\n\\n•  Several meetings were held in towns such as Dinajpur Pabna, Faridpur etc. It was in these \\nmeetings that the pledge to boycott foreign goods was first taken.\\n\\n•  The formal proclamation of the Swadeshi movement was made on 7 August 1905 in a meeting held in \\nthe Calcutta town hall. The famous boycott resolution was passed.\\n\\n•  The leaders like SN Banerjee toured the country urging the boycott of Manchester cloth and \\nLiverpool salt.\\n\\n•  The value of British cloth sold in some of the districts fell by five to fifteen times between \\nSeptember 1904 and September 1905.\\n\\n•  The day the partition took effect — 16 October 1905 — was declared a day of mourning throughout \\nBengal.\\n\\n•  The movement soon spread to the entire country.\\n\\n• Militant nationalists\\n\\no  The extremists were in favor of extending the movement to the rest of India and carrying it \\nbeyond the programme of just Swadeshi and boycott to a full fledged political mass struggle. The \\nmoderates were not as willing to go that far.\\no The differences between the extremists and moderates came to had in 1907 Surat session where the \\nparty split with serious consequences for the Swadeshi Movement.\\no In Bengal, the extremists acquired a dominant influence over the Swadeshi movement.\\n\\no They proposed the technique of extended boycott which included, apart from boycott of foreign \\ngoods, boycott of government schools and colleges, courts, titles and government services and even \\nthe organization of strikes.\\no Aurobindo Ghose: Political freedom is the lifebreath of a nation.\\no Boycott and public burning foreign cloth, picketing of shops selling foreign goods, became common \\nin remote corners of Bengal as well as in many towns across the country.\\no  The militant nationslists, however, failed to give a positive leadership to the people.\\nThey also failed to reach the real masses of the country, the peasants.\\n\\n•  The movement also innovated with considerable success different forms of mass mobilization such \\nas public meetings, processions and corps of volunteers.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  The Swadesh Bandhab Samiti set up by Ashwini Kumar Dutt, a school teacher, in Barisal was the \\nmost well known volunteer organization.\\n\\n•  During the Swadeshi period, traditional festivals were used to reach out to the masses. The \\nGanapati and Shivaji festivals were popularized by Tilak. Traditional folk theatres such as jatras \\nwere also used.\\n\\n•  Another important aspect was the great emphasis given to self-reliance or Atmasakti as a \\nnecessary part of the struggle against the government.\\n\\n• Self-reliance was the keyword. Campaigns for social reforms were carried out.\\n\\n• In 1906, the National Council for Education was setup to organize the education system.\\n\\n• Self-reliance also meant an effort to set up Swadeshi or indigenous enterprises.\\n\\n• Marked impact in the cultural sphere\\na  The songs composed by Rabindranath Tago, Mukunda Das and others became the moving spirit for \\nnationalists.\\n\\na  Rabindranath\\'s ’Amar Sonar Bangla’, written at that time, was to later inspire the liberation \\nstruggle of Bangladesh and was adopted as the national anthem of the country in 1971.\\no  Nandalal Bose, who left a major imprint on Indian art, was the first recipient of a scholarship \\noffered by the Indian Society of Oriental Art founded in 1907.\\n\\n•  The social base of the national movement was now extened to include certain zamindari section, \\nlower middle class and school and college students. Women also participated in large numbers.\\n\\n•  Drawback: Was not able to garner the support of the mass of Muslims, especially the muslim \\npeasantry. The British policy of communalism responsible for this.\\n\\n• By mid-1908, the movement was almost over. The main reasons were:\\no The government, seeing the revolutionary potential of the movement, came down with a heavy hand.\\no The split of the congress in 1907 had weakened the movement.\\no The movement lacked an effective organization and party structure.\\no The movement decline dpartially because of the logic of the mass movements itself\\n— they cannot be endlessly sustained at the same pitch of militancy and self-sacrifice.\\n\\n•  The anti-partition movement, however, marked a great revolutionary leap forward for Indian \\nnationalism.\\n\\n• The decline of Swadeshi engendered the rise of revolutionary terrorism.\\n\\n• Assessing the movement\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\no Cultural impact\\no Social l mpact\\no Economic impact\\no Role of students and Women\\na  All India aspect of the movement\\no From passive protest to active boycott Revolutionary Terrorism\\n• Revolutionary young men did not try to generate a mass revolution. Instead they followed the \\nstrategy of assassinating unpopular officials\\n• 1904: VD Savarkar organized Abhinav Bharat\\n•  Newspapers like The Sandhya and Yugaantar in Bengal and the Kal in Maharashtra advocated \\nrevolutionary ideology\\n•  Kingsford Incident: In 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki threw bomb at a carriage they \\nbelieved was carrying Kingsford, the unpopular judge of Muzaffarpur.\\n• Anushilan Samiti threw a bomb at the Viceroy Lord Hardinge\\n• Centres abroad\\no In London: led by VD Savarkar, Shyamaji Krishnavarma and Har Dayal\\no In Europe: Madam Cama and Ajit Singh\\n•  They gradually petered out. It did not have any base among the people\\n\\nCHAPTER 11: The Split in the Congress\\n\\n• Moderates were successful to some extent.\\n\\n• Moderates failed in many aspects. Why?\\na  They could not acquire any roots among common people.\\n\\no They believed that they could persuade the rulers to change their policies. However, their \\nachievement in this regard was meager.\\n\\no They could not keep pace with the events. They failed to meet the demands of the new stage of the \\nnational movement.\\n\\n•  The British were keen on finishing the Congress because:\\no However moderate the leaders were, they were still nationalists and propagators of \\nanti-colonialist ideas.\\no  The British felt that moderates led congress could be finished off easily because it did not \\nhave a popular base\\n\\n• In the swadeshi movement, all sections of INC united in opposing the Partition\\na  However, there was much difference between the moderates and the extremists about the methods \\nand scope of the movement\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\no  The extremists wanted to extend the Swadeshi and Boycott movement from Bengal to the rest of the \\ncountry and to boycott every form of association with the colonial government\\no The moderates wanted to confine the boycott movement to Bengal and even there to limit it to the \\nboycott of foreign goods\\n\\n•  After the Swadeshi movement the British adopted a three pronged approach to deal with congress. \\nRepression-conciliation-suppression.\\no The extremists were reppressed\\no  The moderates were conciliated thus giving them an impression that their further demands would \\nbe met if they disassociated from the extremists. The idea was to isolate the extremists.\\no Once the moderates and extremists were separate the extremists could be suppressed through the \\nuse of state force while the moderates could later be ignored.\\n\\n• The congress session was held on December 26, 1907 at Surat, on the banks of the river Tapti.\\na  The extremists wanted a guarantee that the four Calcutta resolutions will be passed.\\no  They objected to the duly elected president of the year, Rash Behari Ghose. a  There was a \\nconfrontation with hurling of chairs and shoes.\\n•  The government launched a massive attack on the extremists. Newspapers were suppressed. Tilak \\nwas sent to Mandalay jail for six years.\\n\\n•  The extremists were not able to organize an effective alternative party or to sustain the \\nmovement.\\n\\n• After 1908 the national movement as a whole declined.\\n\\n•  The moderates and the country as a whole were disappointed by the 1909 Minto-Morley reforms\\n\\no The number of indirectly elected members of the Imperial and provincial legislative councils was \\nincreased.\\no Separate electorates for Muslims were introduced.\\n\\n• With the split of Congress revolutionary terrorism rose.\\n\\n• In 1904 V D Savarkar organized Abhinav Bharat as a secret society of revolutionaries\\n\\n•  In April 1908, Prafulla Chaki and Khudiram Bose threw a bomb at a carriage which they believed \\nwas occupied by Kingsford the unpopular judge at Muzzafarpur.\\n\\n• Anushilan Samity and Jugantar were two most important revolutionary groups.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n• An assessment of the split\\no The split did not prove useful to either party\\na  The British played the game of divide and rule\\no  To placate the moderates they announced the Morley-Minto reforms which did not satisfy the \\ndemands of the nationalists. They also annulled the partition of Bengal in 1911.\\nMorley-Minto Reforms, 1909\\n\\n•  Increased the number of elected members in the Imperial Legislative Council and the provincial \\ncouncil\\n\\n• However, most of the elected members were elected indirectly\\n\\n• The reformed councils still enjoyed no real power, being merely advisory bodies.\\n\\n•  Introduced separate electorates under which all Muslims were grouped in separate constituencies \\nfrom which Muslims alone could be elected. This was aimed at dividing the Hindus and Muslims. It \\nwas based on the notion that the political and economic interests of Hindus and Muslims were \\nseparate.\\no This later became a potent factor in the growth of communalism\\n\\no It isolated the Muslims from the Nationalist Movement and encouraged separatist tendencies\\n\\n•  The real purpose of the reforms was to confuse the moderate nationalists, to divide nationalist \\nranks and to check the growth of unity among Indians\\n\\n• Response of Moderates\\no They realized that the reforms had not granted much\\no However, they decided to cooperate with the government in working the reforms\\no This led to their loss of respect among the nationalists and masses Growth of Communalism\\n• Definition\\no  Communalism is the belief that because a group of people follow a particular religion they have, \\nas a result, common secular, that is, social, political and economic interests.\\n\\na  Second stage: Secular interests of followers of one religion are dissimilar and divergent from \\nthe interests of the followers of another religion\\n\\na  Third stage: The interests of the followers of different religions or of different religious \\ncommunities are seen to be mutually incompatible, antagonistic and hostile.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  Communalism is not a remnant of the medieval period. It has its roots in the modern colonial \\nsocio-economic political structure.\\n\\n•  Divide and Rule\\na  After 1857, British initially suppressed Indian muslims. However, after the publishing of \\nHunter\\'s book ‘The Indian Mussalman\\' they actively followed the policy of divide and rule and hence \\nstarted supporting the Muslims.\\no They promoted provincialism by talking of Bengal domination\\na  Tired to use the caste structure to turn the non-brahmins against Brahmins and the lower caste \\nagainst the higher castes.\\n\\na  It readily accepted communal leaders as authentic representatives of all their co-religionists.\\n\\n• Reasons for growth of communal tendencies in Muslims\\n\\na  Relative backwardness: educationally and economically <incompIete>\\n\\nMuslim League\\n\\n•  1906 by Aga Khan, the Nawab of Dhaka, and Nawab Mohsin-uI-Mulk\\n\\n•  It made no critique of colonialism, supported the partition of Bengal and demanded special \\nsafeguards for the Muslims in government services.\\n\\n• ML\\'s political activities were directed not against the foreign rulers but against the Hindus and \\nthe INC.\\n\\n•  Their activities were not supported by all Muslims\\no  Arhar movement was founded at this time under the leadership of Maulana Mohamed Ali, Hakim Ajmal \\nKhan, Hasan Imam, Maulana Zafar Ali Khan, and Mazhar- uI-Haq. They advocated participation in the \\nmilitant nationalist movement.\\nMuslim Nationalists\\n\\n• The war between Ottoman Empire and Italy created a wave of sympathy for Turkey\\n\\n•  During the war between Ottoman empire and Italy, India sent a medical mission headed by MA \\nAnsari to help Turkey.\\n\\n•  As the British were not sympathetic to Turkey, the pro-CaIiph sentiments in India became \\nanti-British\\n\\n•  However, the militant nationalists among muslims did not accept an entirely secular approach to \\npolitics\\n\\n•  The most important issue they took up was not political independence but protection of the \\nTurkish empire.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  This approach did not immediately clash with Indian nationalism. However, in the long run it \\nproved harmful as it encouraged the habit of looking at political questions from a religious view \\npoint.\\nHindu Communalism\\n\\n•  Some Hindus accepted the colonial view of Indian history and talked about the tyrannical Muslim \\nrule in the medieval period\\n\\n• Over language they said that Hindi was the language of Hindus and Urdu that of Muslims.\\n\\n•  Punjab Hindu Sabha was founded in 1909. Its leaders attached the INC for trying to unite Indians \\ninto a single nation.\\n\\n•  The first session of the All India Hindu Mahasabha was held in April 1915 under the \\npresidentship of the Maharaja of Kasim Bazar.\\n\\n•  It however remained a weak organization because the colonial government gave it few concessions \\nand little support.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12: World War I and Indian Nationalism\\n\\n• Increasing number of Indians from Punjab were emigrating to North America.\\n\\n•  The British government thought that these emigrants would be affected by the idea of liberty. \\nHence, they tried to restrict emigration.\\n\\n•  Tarak Nath Das, an Indian student in Canada, started a paper called Free Hindustan.\\n\\n•  The Hindi Association was setup in Portland in May 1913.\\n\\n•  Under the leadership of Lala Har Dayal, a weekly paper, The Ghadar was started and a \\nheadquarters called Yugantar Ashram was set up in San Fransisco.\\n\\n•  On November 1, 1913, the first issue of Ghadar was published in Urdu and on December 9, the \\nGurumukhi edition.\\n\\n• In 1914, three events influenced the course of the Ghadar movement: o The arrest and escape of \\nHar Dayal\\na  The Komagata Maru incident\\no Outbreak of the first world war\\n\\n•  Gharadites came to India and made several attempts to instill the Indian population to revolt. \\nHowever, this was of no avail.\\n\\n•  The Ghadar movement was very secular in nature.\\n\\n• Ghadar militants were distinguished by their secular, egalitarian, democratic and non- \\nchauvinistic internationalist outlook.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  The major weakness of the Ghadar leaders was that they completely under-estimated the extent and \\namount of preparation at every level — organizational, ideological, strategic, tactical, financial \\n— that was necessary before an attempt at an armed revolt could be organized.\\n\\n•  It also failed to generate an effective and sustained leadership that was capable of integrating \\nthe various aspects of the movement.\\n\\n• Another weakness was its almost non-existent organizational structure.\\n\\n•  Some important leaders: Baba Gurmukh Singh, Kartar Singh Saraba, Sohan Singh Bhakna, Rahmat Ali \\nShah, Bhai Parmanand and Mohammad Barkatullah.\\n\\n•  Inspired by the Ghadar Party, 700 soldiers at Singapore revolted under the leadership of Jamadar \\nChisti Khan and Subedar Dundey Khan. The rebellion was crushed.\\n\\n•  Other revolutionaries: Jatin Mukharjee, Rash Bihari Bose, Raja Mahendra Pratab, Lala Hardayal, \\nAbdul Rahim, Maulana Obaidullah Sindhi, Champakaraman Pillai, Sardar Singh Rana and Madame Cama\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13: The Home Rule Movement\\n\\n•  After being released in 1914, Tilak sought re-entry into Congress. Annie Besant and Gokhale \\nsupported. But finally Pherozshah Mehta won and Tilak was not admitted.\\n\\n•  Tilak and Besant decided to start the home rule movement on their own.\\n\\n•  In early 1915, Annie Besant (and S Subramaniya lyer) launched a campaign through her two \\nnewspapers, New India and Commonweal, and organized public meetings and conferences to demand that \\nIndia be granted self-government on the lines of the White colonies after the War. From April 1915, \\nher tone became more peremptory and her stance more aggressive.\\n\\n•  At the annual session of the Congress in December 1915 it was decided that the extremists be \\nallowed to rejoin the Congress. The opposition from the Bombay group has been greatly weakened by \\nthe death of Pherozshah Mehta.\\n\\n•  Tilak and Annie Besant set up two different home rule leagues.\\n\\n•  Tilak\\'s league was to work in Maharashtra (excluding Bombay city), Karnataka, the central \\nprovinces and Berar and Annie Besant\\'s league was given the charged of the rest of India.\\n\\n•  Tilak was totally secular in nature. There was no trace of religious appeal. The demand for Home \\nRule was made on a wholly secular basis.\\na  “Home rule is my birthright, and I will have it\"\\n\\n•  The British were aliens not because they belonged to another religion but because they did not \\nact in the Indian interest\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  Tilak\\'s league was organized into six branches, one each in Central Maharashtrra, Bombay city, \\nKarnataka, and Central Provinces, and two in Berar.\\n\\n•  On 07/23/1916, on Tilak\\'s sixtieth birthday the government sent a notice asking him to show \\ncause why he should not be bound over for good behavior for a period of one year and demanding \\nsecurities of Rs 60000\\n\\n•  Tilak was defended by a team of lawyers led by Mohammad Ali Jinnah. He won. Tilak used the \\nopportunity to further the Home Rule movement.\\n\\n•  In Besant\\'s league, the main thrust of activity was directed towards building up an agitation \\naround the demand for Home Rule. This was to be achieved by promoting political education and \\ndiscussion.\\n\\n•  Lucknow Pact: 1916 in the Congress Session at Lucknow. Also known as Congress League Pact. \\nExtremists were accepted back in congress. An agreement was reached between Muslim League and \\nCongress.\\n\\n•  The turning point in the movement came with the arrest of Annie Besant in June 1917\\n\\n•  There was wide agitation and many leaders joined the league.\\n\\n•  The government agreed to grant self rule but the timing for such a change was to be decided by \\nthe government alone.\\n\\n•  After the great advance in 1917, the movement gradually dissolved.\\na  The moderates were pacified by the government\\'s assurance of reforms after Besant\\'s release.\\n\\na  The publication of scheme of government reforms in July 1918 further created divisions. Many \\nrejected it while others were for giving it a trial.\\n\\na  Later, Tilak went to England to fight a case. With Besant unable to give a firm lead, and Tilak \\naway in England, the movement was left leaderless.\\n\\n• Achievements of the movement\\no  The achievement of the Home Rule movement was that it created a generation of ardent \\nnationalists who formed the backbone of the national movement in the coming years.\\no  The Home rule leagues also created organizational links between town and country which were to \\nprove invaluable in later years.\\n\\no By popularizing the idea of self-government, it generated a widespread pro- nationalist \\natmosphere in the country.\\n\\no The movement set the right mood for the entry of Mahatma Gandhi and take the leadership.\\n\\nLucknow Pact (1916)\\n\\n• Nationalists saw that their disunity was affecting their cause\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  Two important developments at the Lucknow Session of Congress o The two wings of the Congress \\nwere again united\\na  The Congress and the Muslim League sank their old differences and put up common political \\ndemands before the government.\\n\\n•  INC and ML passed the same resolutions at their sessions, put forward a joint scheme of \\npolitical reforms based on separate electorates, and demanded that the British Government should \\nmake a declaration that it would confer self-government on India at an early date.\\n\\n•  The pact accepted the principle of separate electorates\\n\\n• Main clauses of the pact\\n\\no There shall be self-government in India.\\no  Muslims should be given one-third representation in the central government.\\no  There should be separate electorates for all the communities until a community demanded joint \\nelectorates.\\no A system of weightage should be adopted.\\no  The number of the members of Central Legislative Council should be increased to 150.\\no  At the provincial level, four-fifth of the members of the Legislative Councils should be elected \\nand one-fifth should be nominated.\\no  The size of provincial legislatures should not be less than 125 in the major provinces and from \\n50 to 75 in the minor provinces.\\no  All members, except those nominated, should be elected directly on the basis of adult franchise.\\no  No bill concerning a community should be passed if the bill is opposed by three-fourth of the \\nmembers of that community in the Legislative Council.\\no  The term of the Legislative Council should be five years.\\no  Members of Legislative Council should themselves elect their president.\\no  Half of the members of Imperial Legislative Council should be Indians.\\no The Indian Council must be abolished.\\no  The salaries of the Secretary of State for Indian Affairs should be paid by the British \\ngovernment and not from Indian funds.\\no  Of the two Under Secretaries, one should be Indian.\\no  The Executive should be separated from the Judiciary.\\n• Evaluation\\na  As an immediate effect, the unity between the two factions of the congress and between INC and \\nML aroused great political enthusiasm in the country\\na  However, it did not involve Hindu and Muslim masses and was based on the notion of bringing \\ntogether the educated Hindus and Muslims as separate political entities without secularization of \\ntheir political outlook\\n\\no  The pact therefore left the way open to the future resurgence of communalism in Indian politics.\\n\\n•  Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\no Provincial LC enlarged. More elected members\\no Dyarchy\\n•  Some subjects were reserved and remained under the direct control of the Governor; others such \\nas education, public health and local self-government were called transferred subjects and were to \\nbe controlled by the ministers responsible to the legislature.\\no At the centre, there were two houses of legislature.\\no Response of nationalists\\n•  INC condemned the reforms as disappointing and unsatisfactory\\n\\n•  Some others , led by Surendranath Banerjea, were in favour of accepting the government \\nproposals. They left the Congress at this time and founded the Indian Liberal Federation\\na  Evaluation\\n\\n•  The governor could overrule the ministers on any grounds that he considered special\\n•  The legislature had virtually no control over the Governor-General and his Executive Council.\\n\\n•  The central government had unrestricted control over the provincial governments\\n\\n\\nRowlatt Act\\n\\n• March 1919\\n\\n• It authorized the Government to imprison any person without trial and conviction in a court of \\nlaw.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14: Gandhi\\'s early career and activism\\n\\n•  Gandhi was the first Indian barrister to have come to South Africa.\\n\\n•  He was faced with various racial discriminations within days of his arrival in SA.\\n\\n•  He led the Indian struggle in SA.\\n\\n•  The first phase of Gandhi\\'s political activities from 1894-1906 may be classified as the \\n’moderate’ phase.\\n\\n•  He set up the Natal Indian Congress and started a paper called Indian Opinion.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n• By 1906, Gandhiji, having fully tried the ’Moderate’ methods of struggle, was becoming convinced \\nthat these would not lead anywhere.\\n\\n•  The second phase, begun in 1906, was characterized by the use of passive resistance, Satyagraha. \\nThere was no fear of jails.\\n\\n•  South Africa prepared Gandhiji for leadership of the Indian national struggle: a  He had the \\ninvaluable experience of leading poor Indian labourers.\\na  SA built up his faith in the capacity of the Indian masses to participate in and sacrifice for a \\ncause that moved them.\\na  Gandhiji also had the opportunity of leading Indians belonging to different religions.\\n\\n•  South Africa provided Gandhiji with an opportunity for evolving his own style of politics and \\nleadership.\\n•  Gandhi returned to India on 01/09/1915\\n•  He founded the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad in 1916\\n• Initially he was politically idle. He spent his time studying the situation of the country.\\n•  He was deeply convinced that the only viable method of political struggle was satyagraha.\\n• During the course of 1917 and early 1918, he was involved in three significant struggles\\n— in Champaran in Bihar, in Ahmedabad and in Kheda in Gujarat. The common feature of these \\nstruggles was that they related to specific local issues and that they were fought for the economic \\ndemands of the masses.\\n• Champaran Satyagraha (1917)\\na  Peasantry on the indigo plantations in Champaran, Bihar was excessively oppressed by the \\nEurpoean planters.\\na  On the invitation of the peasants he went to Champaran and began to conduct a detailed inquiry \\ninto the condition of the peasantry\\no  The government was forced to set up a committee with Gandhi as one of the members.

He formed the \\nSatyagraha Sabha whose members took a pledge to disobey the Act and thus to court arrest and \\nimprisonment.\\n•  Satyagraha was launched. The form of protest finally decided was the observance of a nation-wide \\nhartal accompanied by fasting and prayer.\\n• However, protests were generally accompanied by violence and disorder.\\n•  In Punjab, the situation was particularly violent. Genral Dyer was called to control the \\nsituation. On 13 April, Baisakhi Day, General Dyer ordered to open fire on unarmed crowd in \\nJallianwala Bagh. The government estimate was 379 dead, other estimates were considerably higher.\\n•  Gandhiji, overwhelmed by the total atmosphere of violence, withdrew the movement on 18 April.\\n• Difference between earlier methods of struggle and satyagraha\\na  Earlier, the movement had confined its struggle to agitation. They used to hold meetings, \\ndemonstrate, boycott etc\\na  Through Satyagraha they could act now.\\no  The new movement relied increasingly on the political support of the peasants, artisans and \\nurban poor.\\no Gandhiji increasingly turned the face of nationalism towards the common man\\n• Jallianwala Bagh Massacre\\no On 04/13/1919 a large crowd had gathered in Amritsar to protest against the arrest of their \\nleaders, Dr. Saifudding Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal\\no General Dyer opened fire\\na  Widespread criticism. Tagore returned his knighthood.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15: Non Co-operation Movement\\n\\n•  Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms 1919: Dyarchy\\n\\n•  In a system called \"dyarchy,\" the nation-building departments of government — agriculture, \\neducation, public works, and the like — were placed under ministers who were individually \\nresponsible to the legislature. The departments that made up the \"steel frame\" of British rule — \\nfinance, revenue, and home affairs — were retained by executive councillors who were nominated by \\nthe Governor.\\n\\n• The Hunter Committee report praised the actions of general Dyer.\\n\\n• Khilafat Movement\\no For support of Turkey\\no Khilafat Committee formed under the leadership of Ali Brothers, Maulana Azad,\\nHakim Ajmal Khan and Hasrat Mohani\\no The promises made to the Khilafat Committee were not kept after the World War.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\no The All-India Khilafat Conference held at Delhi in November 1919 decided to withdraw all \\ncooperation from the government if their demands were not met.\\n\\no On 06/09/1920, the Khilafat Committee at Allahabad unanimously accepted the suggestion of \\nnon-cooperation and asked Gandhiji to lead the movement.\\n\\n• Khilafat movement cemented Hindu-Muslim unity\\no  Gandhiji looked upon the Khilafat agitation as “an opportunity of uniting Hindus and Mohammedans \\nas would not arise in a hundred years”\\n\\n•  The non-cooperation movement was launched on 01/08/1920.

On hearing this, Gandhiji decided to withdraw the movement.\\n\\n•  The congress working committee ratified his decision. Thus, on 02/12/1922, the non- \\ncooperation movement came to an end.\\n\\n• Assessing the Withdrawal:\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\no Some scholars say that Gandhiji withdrew the movement because he wanted to protect the interests \\nof the propertied class.\\n\\no  Some argue that there was no logic why a small incident should lead to withdrawal of the \\nmovement itself.\\n\\no However, government could use Chauri Chaura to justify its repression of the movement.\\no  If movement was started at that time, it would have been defeated due to the repression of the \\ngovernment.\\no Gandhiji was protecting the movement from likely repression, and the people from demoralization.\\n\\no Mass movements tend to ebb in some time. Hence, withdrawal is a part of the strategy of mass \\nmovements.\\n\\n•  Gandhiji was tried in 1922 and sentenced to six years\\' imprisonment.\\no He invited the court to award him “the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in \\nlaw is a deliberate crime, and what appears to be the highest duty of a citizen\".\\n\\n• Positives out of the non-cooperation movement:\\n\\no Congress started commanding the support and sympathy of vast sections of the Indian people.\\n\\no Millions of Indians became politically involved. Women were drawn into the movement.\\n\\no Muslims participated heavily and communal unity was maintained.\\n\\no Strengthened the national movement. Nationalist sentiments and the national movement had reached \\nthe remotest corners of the land.o People gained tremendous self-confidence and self-esteem.\\nCHAPTER 16: Peasant Movements\\n• Three important peasant movements of the early twentieth century:\\no Kisan Sabha and Eka movements in Avadh in UP\\no Mappila rebellion in Malabar\\no Bardoli Satyagrah in Gujarat\\n•  The UP Kisan Sabha was set up in February 1918 through the efforts of Gauri Shankar Mishra and \\nIndra Narain Dwivedi with the support of Madan Mohan Malviya.\\n• By June 1919, it had established about 450 branches in 173 tehsils of the province.\\n• In August 1921, Mappila (Muslim) tenants rebelled. Their grievances related to lack of any \\nsecurity of tenure, renewal fees, high rents and other oppressive labndlord exactions.\\n• The no-tax movement was launched in Bardoli taluq of Surat district in Gujarat in 1928.\\nCHAPTER 17: The Working Class Movements\\n•  There were some working class movements in second half of 19ᵗʰ century. However, they were \\nimpulsive and not very well organized.\\n•  The early nationalists had a lukewarm attitude towards the question of workers. This war because \\ninitially Congress wanted to focus on issues which were of common concern to all the people of \\nIndia.\\n•  There was a difference in attitude of the nationalists towards workers in indigenous and \\nEuropean enterprises.\\n•  The most important feature of the labour movement during the Swadeshi days was the shift from \\nagitation and struggles on purely economic questions to the involvement of the worker with the \\nwider political issues of the day.\\n•  The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) was founded in 1920.\\n• IN 1918 Gandhi founded the Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association.\\n•  The AITUC in November 1927 took a decision to boycott the Simon Commission and many workers \\nparticipated in the massive Simon boycott demonstrations.\\n•  Alarmed by worker\\'s movement, the government enacted repressive laws like the Public Safety Act \\nand Trade Disputes Acts and arrested the entire radical leadership of the labour movement and \\nlaunched the Meerut Conspiracy Case against them.\\n•  The labour movement suffered a major setback partially due to this government offensive and \\npartially due to a shift in stance of the communist led wing of the movement.\\n• From the end of 1928, the communists stopped aligning them with the national movement.\\n• Communists got isolated within the AITUC and were thrown out in the split of 1931.\\n• BY 1934, the communists re-entered the mainstream nationalist politics.\\n•  The working class of Bombay held an anti-war strike on 02/10/1939.\\n•  With the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, the communists changed their policy and asked \\nthe people to support the allied forces instead of holding anti-war strikes.\\n•  The communists dissociated themselves from the Quit India movement launched in 1942.\\n•  The last years of colonial rule also saw a remarkably sharp increase in strikes on economic \\nissues all over the country — the all India strike of the post and telegraph department employees \\nbeing the most well known among them.\\nCHAPTER 18: Struggles for Gurudwara Reform and Temple Entry\\n• The Akali movement\\n•  The movement arose with the objective of freeing the Gurudwaras from the control of ignorant and \\ncorrupt priests (mahants).\\n•  Apart from the mahants, after the British annexation of Punjab in 1849, some control over the \\nGurudwaras was exercised by Government-nominated managers and custodians, who often collaborated \\nwith mahants.\\n•  The government gave full support to the mahants. It used them to preach loyalism to the Sikhs \\nand to keep them away from the rising nationalist movement.\\n•  The agitation for the reform of Gurudwaras developed during 1920 when the reformers organized \\ngroups of volunteers known as jathas to compel the mahants and the government appointed managers to \\nhand over control of the Gurudwaras to the local devotees.\\n•  Tens of Gurudwaras were liberated within an year.\\n•  To manage the control of Golden Temple and othe rGurudwaras the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak \\nCommittee was formed in November 1920.\\n• Feeling the need to give the reform movement a structure, the Shiromani Akali Dal was established \\nin December 1920.\\n• The SGPC and Akali Dal accepted complete non-violence as their creed.\\n•  There was a clash between the mahant and the Akalis over surrendering the gurudwara at Nanakana. \\nThis led to killing of about 100 akalis.\\n•  The Nankana tragedy led to the involvement of Sikhs on a large scale in the national movement.\\n•  Keys Affair: In October 1921, the government refused to surrender the possession fo the keys of \\nthe Toshakhana of the golden temple of the Akalis. This led to protests. Leaders like Baba Kharak \\nSingh and Master Tara Singh were arrested. Later, the government surrendered the keys to keep the \\nSikhs from revolting.\\n•  Guru ka Bagh gurudwara in Ghokewala was under dispute as the mahant there claimed that the land \\nattached to it was his personal possession. When few akalis cut down a tree on that land they were \\narrested on the complain of the mahant. Seeing this thousands of akalis came and started cutting \\ndown the trees. About 4000 akalis were arrested. Later, the government didn\\'t arrest but started \\nbeating them up severly. But the alakis kept turning up. Ultimately the government had to \\nsurrender.\\n• The akali movement made a huge contribution to the national awakening of Punjab.\\n•  However, the movement encouraged a certain religiosity which would be later utilized by \\ncommunalism.\\n• In 1923, the Congress decided to take active steps towards the eradication of untouchability.\\n• The basic strategy it adopted was to educate and mobilize opinion among caste hindus.\\n•  Immediately after the Kakinada session, the Kerala Provincial Congress Committee (KPCC) took up \\nthe eradication of untouchability as an urgent issue.\\n•  KPCC adeiced to organize an procession on the temple roads in Vaikom, a village in Travancore, \\non 30/03/1924.\\n• During the processions, the satyagrahis were arrested and sentenced to imprisonment.\\n• On the death of Maharaja in August 1924, the Maharani released the Satyagrahis.\\n•  Gandhiji visited Kerala to discuss the opening of temple with Maharani. A compromise was reached \\nwhereby all roads except for the ones in the Sankethan of the temple were opened to the harijans.\\n• In his Kerala tour, Gandhi didn\\'t visit a single temple because avarnas were kept out of them.\\n•  The weakness of the anti-caste movement was that through it aroused people against \\nuntouchability it lacked a strategy of ending the caste system itself.\\nCHAPTER 19: The years of Stagnation\\n•  Gandhiji was arrested in 1922 and sentenced to 6 years of imprisonment. The result was the \\nspread of disintegration, disorganization and demoralization in the nationalist ranks.\\n•  After a defeat of their resolution of ‘either mending or ending’ in the Congress, CR Das and \\nMotilal Nehru resigned and formed the Congress-Khilafat Swaraj Party in December 1922.\\no It was to function as a group within the congress\\n•  How to carry on political work in the movements’ non-active phases. The swarajists said that \\nwork in the council was necessary to fill the temporary political void. The no-changers believed \\notherwise.\\n• Major no-changers: Sardar Patel, Dr Ansari, Rajendra Prasad\\n•  The no-changers opposed council-entry mainly on the ground that parliamentary work would lead to \\nthe neglect of constructive and other work among the masses , the loss of revolutionary zeal and \\npolitical corruption.\\n•  Despite the differences, he two groups had a lot in common.\\no The need for unity was very strongly felt by all the Congressmen after the 1907 debacle.\\na  Both realized that the real sanctions which would compel the government to accept the national \\ndemands would be forged only by a mass movement.\\na  Both groups fully accepted the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.\\n•  In the session held in 1923, the congressmen were permitted to stand as candidates and exercise \\ntheir franchise in the forthcoming elections.\\n•  Gandhiji was released on 05/02/1924. He did not agree with the Swarajists. However, slowly \\nhe moved towards an accommodation with the swarajists.\\n•  On 06/11/1924, Gandhiji brought the strife between the Swarajists and no-changers to an \\nend, by signing a joint statement with Das and Motilal that the Swarajists Party would carry on \\nwork in the legislatures on behalf of the Congress and as an integral part of the Congress. This \\ndecision was endorsed in Belgaum.\\n•  The Swarajists did well in the elections and won 42 out of 101 seats in the Central Legislative \\nAssembly.\\n• In March 1925, Vithalbhai J Patel was elected as he President (speaker) of the Central \\nLegislative Assembly.\\n•  The achievement of the Swarajists lay in filling the political void at a time when the national \\nmovement was recouping its strength.\\no They also exposed the hollowness of the reforms of 1919\\n• After the petering out of the NCM communalism took stronghold\\no  Even within the Congress, a group known as ‘responsivists’, including Madan Mohan Malviya, Lala \\nLajpat Rai and NC Kelkar, offered cooperation to the government so that the so-called Hindu \\ninterests might be safeguarded.\\n\\nCHAPTER 20: Bhagat Singh\\n\\n•  The sudden suspension of the non-cooperation movement led many young people to question the very \\nbasis strategy of non-violence and began to look for alternatives.\\n•  All the major new revolutionary leaders had been enthusiastic participants in the non- violent \\nnon-cooperation movement.\\n•  Two separate strands of revolutionary terrorism developed — one in Punjab, UP and Bihar and the \\nother in Bengal.\\n• Ramprasad Bismil, Jogesh Chatterjea and Sachindranath Sanyal met in Kanpur in October 1924 and \\nfounded the Hindustan Republican Association to organize armed revolution.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  In order to carry out their activities the HRA required funding. The most important action of \\nthe HRA was the Kakori Robbery.\\n•  On August 9, 1925, ten men held up the 8-Down train from Shahjahanpur to Lucknow at Kakori and \\nlooted its official railway cash.\\n•  The government arrested a large number of young men and tried them in the Kakori Conspiracy \\nCase.\\n•  Ashfaqulla Khan, Ramprasadn Bismil, Roshan Singh and Rajendra Lahiri were hanged, four others \\nwere sent to Andaman while seventeen others were sentenced to long term imprisonment.\\n•  New revolutionaries joined the HRA. They met at Ferozshah Kotla Ground at Delhi on 9 and 10 \\nSeptember 1928, created a new collective leadership, adopted socialism as their official goal and \\nchanged the name of the party to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association.\\n•  Lala Lajpat Rai dies in a lathi-charge when he was laeding an anti-Simon Commission \\ndemonstration at Lahore on 30 October 1928.\\n•  On 17 December 1928, Bhagat Singh, Azad and Rajguru assassinated, at Lahore, Saunders, a police \\nofficial involved in the lathi-charge on Lala Lajpat Rai.\\n•  In order to let the people know about HSRA\\'s changed objectives Bhagat Singh and BK Dutt were \\nasked to throw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly on 8 April 1929 against the passage of \\nthe Public Safety Bill and the Trade Disputes Bill.\\n•  He aim was not to kill but to let people know of their objectives through the leaflet they \\nthrew.\\n•  They were later arrested and tried.\\n•  The country was also stirred by the hunger strike the revolutionaries took as a protest against \\nthe horrible conditions in jails.\\n•  On 13\\'ʰ September, the 64*ʰ day of the epic fast, Jatin Das died.\\n•  Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were sentenced to be hanged.

The report was an attempt to address this need for a new \\nconstitution. Lord Birkenhead had challenged Indians to produce an agreed constitution. This report \\ncame in that background.\\n•  The ‘Nehru Report’ (1928) was a memorandum outlining a proposed new Dominionconstitution (it was \\nan outline and not a constitution itself) for India. It was prepared by a committee of the All \\nParties Conference chaired by Motilal Nehru with his son Jawaharlal acting as secretary. There were \\nnine other members in this committee including two Muslims.\\n•  The report didn\\'t seek complete independence but, the constitution outlined by the Nehru report \\nwas for India enjoying dominion status within the British Commonwealth. Motilal commented — ‘It\\'s \\non achievement on which any countrY in the world wight well be proud\\n\\n•  Recommendations —\\n•  I. It called for Dominion Status\\n•  II. Unlike the eventual Government of India Act 1935 it contained a Bill o( Rights.\\n•  III. It did not provide (or separate electorates for any community or weightage for minorities.\\n•  IV. It advocated (ederal structure.\\n•  V. Seperation of state from religion\\n•  VI. A parliamentary form o( Government\\n•  VII. Residual powers with (ederal/central government\\n•  VIII. Adu/t (ranchise\\n•  IX. Redistribution o( provincial boundries on a linguistic basis\\n\\n•  Most of its recommendations formed the basis of constitution of independent India.\\n•  Controversies over report -\\n•  I. It did away with Communal/Separate Electorate — this attracted much ire from Muslim league \\nand other minority communities\\n•  II. It asked for Dominion Status and not complete Independence — On this issue, even Jawahar Lal \\ndiffered with his father (which was reflected a year later when he came up with a demand for Purna \\nSwaraj). Nehru and Subhash formed ‘Independence for India League’.\\n\\n•  Neither Muslim League nor Hindu Mahasabha nor ardent Sikhs agreed with the report and it set the \\nstage for the communal confrontation.\\n•  FOURTEEN POINTS, 1929\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  With few exceptions League leaders rejected the Nehru proposals.They objected the provision o( \\nsingle e/ectorote and wanted separate electorate. They also saw residual powers I federal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  structure with center as unacceptable as they were not in majority at national level and feared \\nthat this provision can be misused.\\n•  In reaction, Mohammad Ali Jinnah drafted his Fourteen Points in 1929 which became the core \\ndemands the Muslim community put forward as the price of their participating in an independent \\nunited India.\\n•  Main points of 14 Point Formula were —\\n• I. Separate electorate\\n• II. 33% seats reserved for Muslims in Central Legislatures\\n• III. Residual powers vested with provinces\\n•  IV. Provincial autonomy\\n•  V. No constitutional amendment by the by the center without the concurrence of the states \\nconstituting the federation.\\n• VI. Adequate representation of Muslims in services\\n•  VII. Full religious {reedom to all communities\\n\\n•  However, Gandhi and a few others also, didn\\'t support the separate electorate for Muslim or \\nDalits as he saw it divisive and perpetuating the divide that exist.\\n•  Over Dominion status, Candhiji and Motilo/ argued that consensus over it has been built bYsreat \\nefforts and 2 Years should be given to see government response. After negotiations this time was \\nreduced to 1 year and it was decided that if Dominion Status was not realized during this period a \\ndemand for full independence will be made and Civil Disobedience will be launched.\\n•  In 1929, just before demand for Poorna Swaraj, in an effort to win them over, the viceroy, Lord \\nIrwin, announced in October 1929, a vague offer ot ‘dominion status’ for India in an unspecified \\nfuture, and a Round Table Conference to discuss a future constitution. This did not satisfy the \\nCongress leaders.\\n• RISE OF RADICALS, DEMAND for PURNA SWARAJ (1929)\\n•  Background — Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and Satyamurti became more assertive after \\nthe Nehru Report which defied their expectations by announcing Dominion Status as their demand. \\nHowever, Motilal Nehru and Gandhi were reluctant to shed the gains they have made by demanding \\nDominion Status and they demanded to give a 1 year\\'s time to government. But British didn\\'t relent. \\nThere was some hope after the new Labor government was elected in 1929 (headed by Ramsay McDonald) \\nand new Secretary of State ‘Wedgewood Benn’ was also sympathetic to Indian cause. Viceroy Irwin too \\nraised some hope among likes of Motilal and Gandhi when hinted towards Dominion Staus (which was, \\nhowever, not confirmed) a round table talk for the same. This, however, didn\\'t assuage the \\nsentiments of neither liberals nor Jawahar Lal and others.\\n•  In December 1929, under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru, the Lahore Congress formalized the \\ndemand of ‘Purna Swaraj’ or full independence for India. Jawahar unfurled Indian flag at the bank \\no(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n• Ravi on midnight o{ 31st Oecember. He declared - ‘It\\'s a crime against man and God to\\nsubmit a•Y longer\\'.\\n• Following broad decisions were taken —\\n•  l. Boycott o( Round Table Conference\\n•  II. Demand for Poorna Swaraj\\n•  III. All members o( legislature may resign.\\n•  IV. It was declared that 26 January 1930, would be celebrated as the Independence Day when \\npeople were to take a pledge to struggle for complete independence. Lahore session also marked a \\nleadership shift to younger generation.\\n•  V. It was also decided that a Civil Disobedient movement will be launched under leadership of \\nGandhi\\n\\n•  Call for nation wide meetings was made and it saw huge participation from both Rural and Urban \\nareas and pledges were made for Purna Swaraj.\\n• GANDHI\\'s 11 POINTS, SALT MARCH & CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT, 1930\\n•  Background — After non-action of government over Nehru Report and failure of government to agree \\nupon any demand for even dominion status, Gandhiji was looking for a new plan amidst growing \\nrestlessness among the Congress and nation as a whole.\\n• Mahatma Gandhi found in salt a powerful symbol that could unite the nation. On 31 January 1930 — \\nSoon after demand for Purna Swaraj, he sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin stating eleven demands (11 \\npoints). In his letter to Viceroy he stated — ’British ru/e has impoverished ‘the Dumb Millions’ by \\n6i system of progressive exploitation, reducing us to political serfdom and sapped us cu/turally, \\ndegraded us spiritU0!!y\\n•  Some of these were of general interest; others were specific demands of different classes, from \\nindustrialists to peasants. The idea was to make the demands wide-ranging, so that all classes \\nwithin Indian society could identify with them and everyone could be brought together in a united \\ncampaign.\\n• These included among others —\\n• I. Total prohibition\\n•  II. Release of political prisioners\\n• III. Reduce expenditure on civil services and military\\n•  IV. Levy of duty on foreign cloth\\n• V. Issue of firearm licences\\n•  VI. Reduce land revenue by 50%\\n• VII. Reduce Rupee Sterling exchange ratio to make Indian exports profitable\\n• VIII. Reserve Coastal shipping for Indians\\n• IX. Abolition of Salt Tax.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  The most stirring of all was the demand to abolish the salt tax. Salt was something consumed \\nbYthe rich and the poor alike, and it was one o( the most essential items o{ food.The tax on salt \\nand the government monopO!Yover its production, Mahatma candhi declared, revealed the most \\noppressive faceof British rule. Further, Salt Satyagraha had a potential of mass appeal and \\nmass-involvement. Mahatma Gandhi\\'s letter was, in a way, an ultimatum.\\n•  Indian reaction to proposed 11 Points —\\n•  I. There was some resentment among nationalist leaders over the 11 points as they sow it running \\ncounter the Swaraj Declaration that was made just some time back. However Gandhi wanted to see the \\nsincerity f Brit/sh.\\n•  II. Industrial class whoIehearted!YSUpported Gandhian demands in (ull as they saw them more of \\neconomic nature (levy of duty on foreign cloth and other demands if would have been accepted would \\nhave promoted domestic indutry)\\n\\n•  If the demands were not fulfilled by 11 March, the letter stated, the Congress would launch a \\ncivil disobedience campaign. Irwin was unwilling to negotiate and no-response was given to deamnds. \\nGandhi decided to go for Civil Disobedience. On this, Gandhi commented — ’While he asked (or the \\nbread, he was given a stone\\'on the apathetic attitude of Viceroy and British government over their \\nnon-response to Gandhi\\'s pleas before he started Civil Disobedience Movement.\\n•  So, Mahatma Gandhi started his famous salt march accompanied by 78 of his trusted volunteers \\nwhich also included Sarojini Naidu. Congress vested in Gandhi power to launch Civil Disobedience \\nMovment. The march was over 240 miles, from Gandhiji\\'s ashram in Sabarmati to the Gujarati coastal \\ntown of Dandi. The volunteers walked for 24 days, about 10 miles a day. Thousands came to hear \\nMahatma Gandhi wherever he stopped, and he told them what he meant by swaraj and urged them to \\npeacefully defy the British. On 6 April he reached Dandi, and ceremonially violated the law, \\nmanufacturing salt by boiling sea water. This marked the beginning o( the Civil Disobedience \\nMovement.\\n•  Masses participated in the movement. Salt laws were broken everywhere. Even women participated \\nin huge numbers. Kamla (wife of Nehru), Swarup Rani (Mother of Nehru) were at the forefront. In \\nTamil Nadu, C Rajagopalchari led the march, In Malabar K Kelappan took the lead.\\n•  Thousands in different parts of the country broke the salt law, manufactured salt and \\ndemonstrated in front of government salt factories. As the movement spread, foreign cloth was \\nboycotted, and liquor shops were picketed. Peasants refused to pay revenue and chaukidari taxes, \\nvillage officials resigned, and in many places forest people violated forest laws — going into \\nReserved Forests to collect wood and graze cattle.\\n• Other Impacts —\\n• I. There was a wide scale boYCOttof liquor shops and in protest toddy trees were cut down\\n•  II. Women participated at large scale for the first time\\n•  III. Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan launched a Khudai Khidmatgar Movement at the North West Frotnier \\nProvinces\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n•  IV. Rani Gaidillieu at the age of 13 responded to Gandhian call in Manipur and was sentenced for \\nlife imprisionment and was released only in 1947\\n•  V. Chowkidar Tax Non-Pyment Campaign was initiated in the Eastern part of the nation (Chowkidars \\nwere hated with their pro-government activities and were even considered government spies).\\n• VI. Forest laws were liberally violated in Southern and Central provinces\\n•  VII. Bardoli Satyagraha was launched by Patel just before Civil Disobedience movement and it \\nbecame a model no-tax campaign in other parts of the country during the Civil Disobedience \\nmovement.\\n•  VIII. UP saw another form of ‘No-Revenue, No Rent’ Campign. No-Revenue call was for Zamindars \\nand they were asked not to pay revenue to government and No-rent call was for cultivators.\\n•  IX. A variety of mass mobilization techniques like Prabhat Pheris, Patrikas (illegal newsprint) \\nwere used. Children were organized into Vanar Sena and Girls into Manjari (cat) Sena.\\n\\n•  Dharsana Satyagraha, 1930 - Dharasana Satyagraha was a protest against the British salt tax in \\ncolonial India in May, 1930. Following the conclusion of the Salt March to Dandi, Mahatma Gandhi \\nchose a non-violent raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat as the next protest against British \\nrule. Hundreds of satyagrahis were beaten by soldiers under British command at Dharasana. In a \\npeaceful move led by Sarojini Naidu, (iles o( Satyagrahis (aced the lathis o( police and they te// \\nin line, only to be replaced bY other line. The ensuing publicity attracted world attention to the \\nIndian independence movement and brought into question the legitimacy of British rule in India.\\n•  British Response — Worried by the developments, the colonial government began arresting the \\nCongress leaders one by one. This led to violent clashes in many palaces. A frightened government \\nresponded with a policy of brutal repression. Peaceful Satyagrahis were attacked, women and \\nchildren were beaten, and about 60,000 people were arrested. Big leaders like C Rajagopalachari, \\nVallabhai, Jawahar, Madan Mohan Malviya, J M Sengupta etc were also arrested. Gandhi too was \\narrested in MaY J930 and leadership was transferred to Abbas Tyabji and he too was arrested. Later \\nSarojini took the lead, but she was also arrested. Government came up with many ‘repressive \\nresolutions’, ‘Congress was declared i/legal’.\\n• Success of Movement -\\n•  It rallied masses like never before\\n•  Import of foreign goods was effectively boycotted\\n•  Students and Women participated in masses\\n•  Workers also joined the movement big time\\n\\n• Failures of Movement -\\n•  Not all social groups were moved by the abstract concept of swaraj. One such group was the \\nnation\\'s ‘untouchables’, who from around the 1930s had begun to call themselves dalit or oppressed. \\nFor long the Congress had ignored the dalits, for fear of offending the sanatanis, the conservative \\nhigh-caste Hindus. Dr B R Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed\\n• Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma Gandhi at the second Round Table Conference by \\ndemanding separate electorates for dalits.\\n•  Muslims — except in NWFP under Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan — show apathetic response. They were \\npolarized by communal rhetorics of leaders as well as government\\'s positive response\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nto their demands. After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat movement, a large section of \\nMuslims felt alienated from the Congress. From the mid-1920s the Congress came to be more visibly \\nassociated with openly Hindu religious nationalist groups like the Hindu Mahasabha. As relations \\nbetween Hindus and Muslims worsened, each community organised religious processions with militant \\nfervour, provoking Hindu-Muslim communal clashes and riots in various cities.\\n•  Lukewarm Support from Industrial Class\\n•  Poor participant from peasents\\n•  Non-Cooperation vs Civil Disobedience — People were now asked not only to refuse cooperation \\nwith the British, as they had done in 1921-22, but a/so to break colonial laws. So, it was an \\nideological progression. This time objective was complete independence. There was poor Muslim \\nparticipation this time and labor participation was also poor.\\n•  This movement, however, catapulted Gandhi on international arena and for the first time women \\nalso participated in large number in a national movement.\\n• GANDHI — IRWIN PACT or DELHI PACT (MARCH 1931)\\n•  Background — As British repression became harder during Civil Disobedience Movement, it led to \\nsufferance of common people. In such a situation, Mahatma Gandhi once again decided to call off the \\nmovement and he along with many others was arrested only to be released in 1931. Congress didn\\'t \\nparticipate in {irst Round Table Con(erence which was though attended by Muslim League, Hindu \\nMahasabha, Chamber of Princes, the Liberals and Dalits and it was specu/ated thot 0^y Agreement \\nwithout the participation o( Congress will be (utile. Irwin was also anxious to (ind a so/ution and \\nin a gesture he released the political prisioners and decided to directly talk to Gandhi.\\n•  In this backdrop, Gandhi entered into a pact with Irwin on 5 March 1931. The Pact and direct \\nGandhi-Irwin talks put Congress on equal terms with government and this move o( Irwin was also \\ncriticized in Britain for shedding too much space.\\n•  Below were the proposed conditions —\\n•  I. Discontinuation o( the civil disobedience movement by the Indian National Congress\\n•  II. Participation bY the indian National Congress in the Round Table Con(erence\\n•  III. Withdrawal o( all ordinances issued by the British Government imposing curbs on the \\nactivities of the Indian National Congress\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  IV. Release o( prisoners arrested for participating in the civil disobedience movement V. \\nRemoval o( the tax on sa/t, which allowed the Indians to produce, trade, and sell salt legally and \\nfor their own private use. Things that were not accepted by British as a part of Gandhi Irwin pact \\nor Delhi Pact —\\n•  I. However, Congress demand for a police enquiry into arrests and atrocities made during Civil \\nDisobedience movement was rejected.\\n•  II. Commutation o( sentences o( Bhagat Singh and his comrades\\n•  III. The pact also didn\\'t accept demand o( immediClte return o( the lands confiscated during \\nmovement (this caused musch resentment among the radicals)\\n\\n•  By this Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Gandhiji consented to participate in a Round Table Conference in \\nLondon and the government agreed to release the political prisoners. The pact was criticized by \\nradicals for not extracting definite gains from government and compromising on the demand of Swaraj \\nby agreeing to participate in Round Table Conference. Candhij was perhaps aware thot mass movements \\nare essentia!!Y ‹hort lived and he tried to leverage the situation by extrcicting some gans from \\nBritish government.\\n• KARACHI SESSION (MARCH 1931)\\n•  Background — The Gandhi-Irwin pact was criticised by radical nationalists, for Gandhiji was \\nunable to obtain from the Viceroy a commitment to political independence for Indians; he could \\nobtain merely an assurance of talks towards that possible end. It was organised even as many \\nCongress leaders opposed the Gandhi-Irwin pact, for the government had not accepted even one ot the \\nmajor nation6ilist demands (viz — demand for police enquiry, return of confiscated peasant lands). \\nIt had not agreed even to the demand that the death sentence on Bhagat Singh and his two comrades \\nbe commuted to life imprisonment. It was termed as a bourgeoise agreement, which ignored masses. \\nHowever, the session aimed at approving Gandhi Irwin Pact.\\n•  Gandhiji prevailed upon the session to approve the agreement. He was greeted with black (lag and \\n(lowers bY angry protestors. Further, Candhiji and Congress as national representatives in that \\ncongress was disputed BY three sections - Muslim League, Princly states and BR Ambedkar (he accused \\ncongress of ignoring the welfare of lower castes).\\n•  However, the session is significant from following point of views -\\n•  I. It endorsed Delhi Pact or Gandhi Irwin Pact\\n•  II. For the first time it moved a resolution on Fundamental Rights and the draft resolution was \\nprepared bY Jawahar Lal Nehru (session was presided over by Vallabhai Patel)\\n•  III. It for the first time explained the concept of Purna Swaraj and reiterated it as goal\\n•  IV. It also declared that interests o( miDOTitY ill be looked after and their culture will be \\npreserved\\n•  V. It acknowledged the brave sacrifice o( Bhagat Singh and others\\n\\n•  Significance of the Karacahi Resolution lies in the fact that — it remained the basic essence of \\npolitical and economic programmes of Congress in later years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  Karachi Congress Resolution, 1931 - Swaraj as conceived by the Congress should include real \\neconomic freedom of the masses. The Congress declares that no constitution will be acceptable to it \\nunless it provides or enables the Swaraj Government to provide for —\\n• I. Freedom of expression, association and meeting.\\n• II. Freedom of religion.\\n• III. Protection of all cultures and languages.\\n•  IV. All citizens shall be equal before the law.\\n• V. No disability in employment or trade or profession on account of religion, caste or sex.\\n•  VI. Equal rights and duties for all in regard to public wells, schools, etc.\\n•  VII. All to have right to bear arms in accordance with regulations.\\n• VIII. No person to be deprived of property or liberty except in accordance with law.\\n• IX. Religious neutrality of State.\\n• X. Adult Suffrage.\\n• XI. Free compulsory primary education.\\n•  XII. No titles to be conferred.\\n• XIII. Capital punishment to be abolished.\\n•  XIV.

Reform of system of land revenue and tenure and rent, exempting rent and revenue for \\nuneconomical holdings and reduction of dues payable for smaller holdings.\\n• XXI. Inheritance tax on graduated scale.\\n•  XXII. Reduction of military expenditure by at least half.\\n• XXIII. No servant of State ordinarily to be paid above Rs 500 per month.\\n• XXIV. Abolition of Salt tax.\\n• XXV. Protection of indigenous cloth against competition of foreign cloth.\\n• XXVI. Total prohibition of intoxicating drinks and drugs.\\n•  XXVII. Currency and exchange in national interest.\\n• XXVIII. Nationalisation of key industries and services, railways, etc.\\n• XXIX. Relief of agricultural indebtedness and control of usury.\\n• XXX. Military training for citizens.\\n• 2nd ROUND SECOND TABLE CONFERENCE (DEC 1931)\\n•  Background - The Congress had boycotted the first Round Table Conference (1930) which was \\nactively attended by princely states, Ambedkar and other non-Congress parties. Ambedkar also raised \\nthe issue of separate electorate for Dalits and Jinnah demanded more safeguards for the Muslims \\n(these two\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  demands were reflected in Communal Award of 1932). After Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Gandhi was sent as a \\nrepresentative of Congress.\\n•  Objective of Round table Conference — Round table conference were in line with the \\nconstitutional progtression envisaged by the British which were outlined by the Simon Commission as \\nwell to chart out a future course of action for political mechanism in India. One of the prime \\nobjective of Congress to participate in it was demand of Indians for more autonomy and dominion \\nstatus.\\n•  Though the round table conferences were termed as 1›‹, 2 d, and 3 d. It will be wrong to term as \\nso because — it was basically a single conference that was held in three sessions.\\n•  In April, before Second Round Table Conference, Irwin was replaced by new Viceroy Willingdon and \\nhe was not ready to take a liberal attitude as taken by Irwin. Even before Gandhi left for \\nConference there were complaints regarding the non-release of prisioners in some areas, repression \\nof Khudai Khidamtgars in NWFP and Gandhi was refused permission to go there.\\n•  Non-Congress parties were involved by the British in a big way at the 2 d Round Table Conference \\nas well. In December 1931, Gandhiji went to London for the conference, but the negotiations broke \\ndownon the minority issue. Not only Muslims demanded separate electorate, this time minorities led \\nby Ambedkar also demanded separate electorate. British also refused to grant Dominion Status a key \\ndemand of Congress. Gandhi pressed upon point of Constitutional reforms and leaving behind communal \\narguments. But no consensus was reached and he returned disappointed. It failed because of initial \\nnon-attendance by the Congress and because Gandhi, who later did attend, claimed he was the only \\nrepresentative of all of India.\\n• Outcomes —\\n• I. Two new Muslim majority provinces — NWFP and Sindh to be created\\n•  II. Setting up of Indian Consultative Committee\\n• III. Prospect of a uni/atera/ Communal Award if Indians failed to agree.\\n•  IV. New right/conservative government under Churchil refused to put Congress on equal footing \\nand adopted a stern attitude, in its aftermath new Viceroy refused to have a meeting with Gandhiji\\n\\n•  Back in India, Gandhi discovered that the government had begun a new cYcle o( repression. Gaffar \\nKhan and Jawaharlal Nehru were both in jail, the Congress had been declared illegal, and a series \\nof measures had been imposed to prevent meetings, demonstrations and boycotts. Press was gagged and \\nCongress was still facing ban. New Viceroy Willington and Secretary of State had adopted a tough \\nstance against Gandhi and they decided not to negotiate any further like the former Viceroy Irwin \\ndidearlier.\\n•  With great apprehension, Mahatma Gandhi relaunched the Civil Disobedience Movement. For over a \\nyear, the movement continued, but by 1934 it lost its momentum due to severe repression by \\ngovernment.\\n• Causes of Failure of 2 d Phase of Civil Disobedience Movement —\\n•  Major Leaders were Behind Bars\\n•  Poor Support from Peasentry\\n•  Inertia and apparent disappointment from Gandhian politics\\n\\n•  To break the lull in activities, council entrY as suggested on the line of Swarajists by \\nSatayamurti which was later endorsed by likes of Bhulabhai Desai, M A Ansari. As a result Congress \\nparticipated in Central Legislative Elections of 1934 and it won a heavy majority.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  Within Congress as well, an alternative ideological development happened and Congress Socialist \\nParty was born as a left leaning faction.\\n•  In the meanwhile, many nationalists thought that the struggle against the British could not be \\nwon through non-violence. In 1928, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army (HSRA) was founded at a \\nmeeting in Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi as an offshoot of Hindustan Republican Association \\nvisibly influenced by socialist ideas. Amongst its leaders were Bhagat Singh, Jatin Das and Ajoy \\nGhosh. In a series of dramatic actions in different parts of India, the HSRA targeted some of the \\nsymbols of British power. In April 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeswar Dutta threw a bomb in the \\nLegislative AssemblY In the same year there was an attempt to blow up the train that Lord Irwin was \\ntravelling in.\\n•  New Viceroy Willigdon who replaced Irwin believed that government did a major mistake by \\nreaching a truce with Congress and by putting Gandhi on equal par. He was determined this time to \\ncrush Congress.\\n• COMMUNAL AWARD (1932) and POONA PACT (1933)\\n•  Background — In the wake of inconclusive Round Table Talks, British government had declared \\nthat, if a consensus was not reached on separate representation of minorities, a unilateral \\ncommunal award will be made. Government kept its promise in form of Communal Award of 1932.\\n•  The Communal Award was by the British Prime Minister Ramsay McDonald on 4 August 1932 to grant \\nseparate electorates to minority communities in India, including Muslims, Sikhs, and Dalit (then \\nknown as the Depressed Classes or Untouchables) in India (during Round Table Discussions, separate \\nelectorate was demanded by not only Muslim Leaders but by Ambedkar and other minorities as well). \\nThe depressed classes were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from special \\nconstituencies in which voters belonging to the depressed classes only could vote.\\n• The award was opposed for provision of separate electorate by Congress and other nationalist \\nleaders and was viewd as a port o( ‘Divide and Rule’ policy of Britain. The Award was highly \\ncontroversial and opposed by Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi called the award as — ‘English Attack on \\nHindu-Mus/im Unity’. He argued that what Dalits need is eradication o( untouchabi/iU and \\ndiscrimination and not {urther division. In the award he saw similar consequences o( Mus/im having \\nseparate e/ector6ite and ultimate/y demanding a separate notion. He began an indefinite hunger \\nstrike at Yerwada Central Jail from September 20, 1932 to protest this Award.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n•  Communal Award was supported by many among the minority communities, most notably the Dalit \\nleader, Dr. B R Ambedkar. Madan Mohan Malviya acted as a mediater between Gandhi and Ambedkar and \\nafter lengthy negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Dr. Ambedkar to have a single Hindu \\nelectorate, with Dalits having seats reserved within it (in fact, seats for Dalits were increased \\nafter the Pact). This is called the Poona Pact. Electorates {or other religions like Muslim and \\nSikh remained separate.\\n•  After this pact, Gandhi put renewed effort towards upIi{tment o( Dalits. He started a magazine \\ncalled — Harijan and he also spent one year in comm••”Y service of Dalits and spreading the message \\nof untouchability. However, orthodox Hindus sternly opposed his efforts.\\n•  Soon after that in 1934, Gandhi renounced the membership of Congress and expressed his desire to \\nput Jawahar in as next leader. As a result, Jawahar was elected president in 1935 and 1936.\\n• GOVERNMENT of INDIA ACT (1935)\\n•  Background — Third Round Table Conference happened in 1932, and no Congress leader participated. \\nHowever its discussion and discussions of earlier Round Tables and Simon Commission recommendations \\nled to the enactment of 1935 Act.\\n• The Act provided for an all India federal structure as a union of Princly States and Provinces. \\nInclusion of  inc/y States was an idea to oct as a balance against the rising notions/ism in the \\nprovinces.\\n• Features of the Act -\\n•  I. It introduced Federalism in India with Princly States and Provinces being its parts and \\nintroduced Federal List, Provincial List and Concurrent List. However, this never became a remits \\nfOt Princly St£ltes didn\\'t approve this.\\n•  II. Provincial Autonomy replaced Provincial Diarchy (after unpopular nature of Dyarchy in \\nProvinces, Simon Commission suggested its abolition) i.e. Responcible ‹Government was introduced in \\nProvinces. Governor has to now act on the advice o( the miniters responsible to Provincial \\nLegislature.\\n•  III. Bicameralism was introduced in 6 out of 11 Provinces.\\n•  IV. There was also to be a bicameral federal legislature in which the (princly) states were \\ngiven disproportionate weight age. Moreover, the representatives of the states were not to be \\nelected *Y he people, but appointed directlY bY the rulers.\\n• V. NWFP was given status of province and Burma was separated from India (Burma became\\npart of India only during British)\\n•  VI. Diarchy at federal/central level was introduced and abolished at provincial level\\n•  VII. Emergency power was vested in Governor General and Governors in Provinces — The \\nGovernor-General and the Governors were to be appointed by the British government. Though power was\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n•  given to provinces, the Governors were given special powers. They could veto legislative action. \\nMoreover, they retained full control over the civil service and the police.Governer General was \\ngiven ‘Emergency Powers’.\\n•  VIII. Separate Electorate was provided for Hindu and Muslims as was provided by 1909 and 1919 \\nActs too.\\n•  IX. Limited Franchise — Only 14 per cent (1/6) of the total population in British India was \\ngiven the right to vote. Even this legislature, in which the princes were once again to be used to \\ncheck and counter the nationalist elements, was denied any real Power.\\n•  X. Key Portfolios were kept under British Control — Defense and foreign affairs remained outside \\nits control, while the Governor-General retained special control over the other subjects.\\n•  XI. Lower house termed as — Legislative Assembly and Upper House as Council of States\\n•  XII. Vote on Budget was also allowed\\n•  XIII. ‘Vote o( No Con(idence’ and ‘Idea o( Collective Representation’ was introduced.\\n•  XIV. There were also other features of the act like — Establishment of a Fedearl Court, A \\nFederal Bank (RBI), Federal Public Service Commission etc.\\n\\n•  Foreign rule was to continue as before; only a (ew popuI• !Y elected ministers were to be added \\nto the structure and the Congress condemned the Act as ‘totally disappointing’. The act was \\ncondemned by one and all. Jawaharlal Nehru termed this Act as — ‘The Act is a car without engines, \\nbut all brakes’.\\n• It didn\\'t mention the Dominion Statusas was promised by Simon Commission.\\n•  It also carried on provision o(separate e/ectorote which wou/d also lead to {urther communal \\ndivide. Separate electorate was long opposed by Congress.\\n•  On the basis of the Act, the first ‘provincial elections’ were held in February 1937 and they \\nconclusively demonstrated that a large majority of Indian people supported the Congress and it \\nrecorded majority in 8 out of 11 provinces. Congress ministries were formed in July 1937 in seven \\nout of eleven provinces. However they had to work under supervision of governor.\\n•  Despite the criticism of the Act at that time, many of the provisions of the Act were adopted by \\nthe government of India after Independence and this act was landmark in terms of concessions \\nprovided to Indians and the changes that it proposed in the governing system. This is the reason \\nthat it is termed as ‘Point o( no return to (reedom’.\\n• Congress for the first time officially demanded establishment of a Contitutional Aseembly\\nin its 1935 session based on adult franchise to draft Constitution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1937 ELECTIONS\\nJawahar Lal Nehru, Bose, Congress Socialists and Communists were against the idea of entering into \\nProvincial elections which were scheduled to be held in 1937 for the first time according to the \\n1935 Act. According to them it defeats their purpose because —\\nPaticipating would dilute their stand and will be akin to cooperating with the repressive \\ngovernment\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAssuming o((ices a(ter elections means having ‘responsibility without power’ as the governing \\nstructure has not changed much\\nAssuming the office would take away the revolutionary character that movement has assumed since \\n1919\\n\\nOthers argued that while focus of congress is still on the activities outside the legislature, \\nentering the legislatures is onIY• short term tactic to bust the Act o( 1935 (rom within and to \\npractiCO!!Y demonstrate the hollowness of the Act. It was also termed as a part of all round \\nstrategy with ultimate goal as independence. With this assurance, Jawahar started his campaign \\nextensively in\\n1936 and in his election manifesto made three things clear —\\n• Goal of Congress is still attainment of Independence\\n• Congress still rejects 1935 Act\\n•  Formation ot Constituent Assembly is sti/I top prioFlty 0( Congress (INC in 1936 for the time \\nproposed to constitute the Constitution Assembly to form the Indian Constitution)\\n\\nCongress won in majority of provinces with exception of Bengal, Sind, Punjab, Assam, NWFP etc and \\nit formed ministries in many of them. To match their acts with their electoral promises, leaders \\ntook the steps like — reduced their salaries, traye/led through trains in second and third class. \\nIt initiated many reforms, passed many legislations, freed political prisioners.\\nThe elations also had another undesirable outcome. /t widened the Aft between Congress and the \\nLeague and it became more communal and more strident in its demand of a separate nation. The \\nCongress\\'s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its \\nsocial support. The Congress\\'s rejection of the League\\'s desire to form a joint Congress League \\ngovernment in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League.\\nHowever, its performance was limited by various factors, especially in the field of agrarian \\nreforms —\\nl. Inherent power still lied with center and Vicer Ys and Governors had the power to veto their\\nresolutions\\nII. Congress had little (inancial resources as lion\\'s share was taken by the Center\\nIII. According to mechanism of bicameralism in provinces, most of the provinces, there were \\n‘legislative councils’ also which had elections on the basis of limited {ronchise and were occupied \\nbY the landlords, zamindars and other elites. A lower house support was often not enough to\\npass a legislation and this led to compromise on many issues including agrarian reforms which ran \\ncounter to the interests of these members.\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIV. Vested interests withing Congress also scuttled its plans of reforms and infightings and \\nbickering further aggravated it\\n\\nMuslim League and 1937 election — The election came as a great disappointment for Muslim League. \\nJinnah was called (rom London to lead Muslim League in 2935, but despite that it secured only \\naround 100 seats out of the allotted 480 seats. This failure left it with no choice but to resort \\nto communalism and it got manifested in the 1937 by elections in UP when it rallied the voters on \\nthe name o{A/lab and Kuran. Nehru strongly condemned this Act. This was turning point in the \\nhistory of communalism in India when it took an extreme form which was aggravated in coming years.\\nTIRUPURI SESSION and FORWARD BLOCK (1939)\\nGandhi had retired from Congress in 1934 and Congress under Jawahar\\'s leadership has acquired a \\ntaste of socialism and radicalism. Subhas was chosen unanimously in February 1938 session of \\nCongress at Haripura to built upon that trend. In that session under the leadership of Bose, \\nCongress passed a resolution to opposition to the impending imperio/istic war.\\nDifference between Gandhi and Subhash — However, Gandhi had a sY pathetic corner (or British in\\nthis hour o( dif(iCuItY and he also didn\\'t like the idea of Subhash to join the other European \\n(orces in a bid to bring (reedom to India. Other issue was Subhash’s plan for industrialised \\ndevelopment, which Gandhi opposed in favor of grass root level changes. These differences came in \\nopen in the next session of Congress of 1939 in Tirupuri when Gandhi fielded Patabhai Sitaramaiya \\nas candidate and he was defeated and Bose re-elected.\\nBose declared its opposition to fascism and imperialism alike and passed a resolution in this \\neffect along with a resolution demanding independence and {orming a constituent assemblY He also \\nopen!Y Criticized moderate policies of Congress and called for an aggressive movement. This open \\ncriticism irked many veterans and 12 o{ the working Committee members (out of 15) resigned and in \\nthe same year Govind Vallabh Pant moved a resolution to form a new working committee under Gandhian \\nleadership. The resolution was passed and Bose stepped down from presidency.\\nCongress Socialist Party refrained from voting and Bose called it as a betrayal. He formed Forwards \\nBlock in 1939, first as a part of Congress then parted ways with it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND WORLD WAR and INDIA\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIn 1939 World war broke out and British declared participation of India in War without permission \\nfrom or consultation with Indians. League (on conditional support thot constitutional decisions \\nwill be taken with its consent) and Princly States supported the War.\\nGandhi expressed sympathy, while Subhash urged for taking benefit of this situation to launch a \\nfull blown movement. Nehru was in middle and argued for refraining from the war and at the same \\ntime not taking advantage. ‘Tell me the di((erence between Imperialism and Fascism’, remarked \\nNehru.\\nBritish o((ered Dominion Status to India outer War, but Congress {ound it too little too late. All \\nCongress ministers resigned (rom provinces in 1939 in protest o( alleged involvement o( India in \\nwar without consultation with Indians. League celebrated 22 December 1939 as ‘Deliverence Day’ from \\nCongress rule.\\nCongress agreed to provide conditional support and put forward two demands — After the war \\nconstituent assembly should be convened\\nImmediately some form of responsible government should be established at the center\\n\\n\\nViceroy Linglithgo rejected these demands. Government tried to use Chamber o(Princes and Muslim \\nLeague against Congress. It further wanted to regain lost ground on pretext of war.\\nA nationalist movement was not initiated by Congress during the war because —\\nGandhi and other leaders thought that cause o{Allied Forces was just and it will be unfair to go \\nfor a national movment at this difficult hour\\nSecondly, communal passions were at an all times high and this threatened any new national movement \\nalso and a movement may degenerate into a communal riot\\nMost importantly, leaders thought that people were not readY I r the mass movement at this stage\\n\\nGandhi wrote — ‘We don\\'t seek our Independence out o{ British ruin’. This view was summed up in the \\nRamgarh Session of the Congress when the working committee passed a resolution to this effect.\\nHowever, as the condition of Allied Forces aggravated and a danger loomed even on India, Congress \\nagreed (or a conditional support i( the British free India after the war.\\nTo negotiate the demands of Indians of Complete dependence Viceroy made an offer known as — ‘August \\nOffer’ — which didn\\'t talk o( independence and was rejected by both League and Congress. In the \\nmeanwhile in 1940, Muslim league demanded a ‘separate constituency’ (still a demand for separate \\nnation was not there) for Muslims in its Lahore Resolution.\\nGandhi launched an Individual Satyagraha in the meanwhile.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAmidst this, British PM sent Staf(ord Cripps to forge a compromise with Gandhi and Congress and \\nseek their support for war. Talks broke down, however, after the Congress insisted that if it was \\nto help the British defend India from the Axis powers, then the Viceroy had first to appoint an \\nIndian as the Defence Member of his Executive Council.\\nTWO NATIONS THEORY and LAHORE RESOLUTION (1940)\\nAmidst all the confusion over war and Congress’ dielemma of joining the war, Muslim League passed a \\nresolution in its 1940 session declaring that ‘Muslims are not a minority, but a separate nation’.\\nThis gave rise to \\'Two notion Theo Y\\' It called for the creation of \\'independent states\\' for \\nMuslims in British India. The constituent units of these states were to be autonomous and sovereign \\n[The name ’Pakistan\\'had been suggested in 1933 by a Cambridge scholar Rehmat Ali, but was not \\n(ormally announced in this resolution].\\nAUGUST OFFER (1940)\\nThe August offer 1940 was made on August 8, 1940 by Viceroy Lord Linglithgow, the eve of the Battle \\nof Britain in which it was beleagured to seek support of India by providing some concessions on \\nfront of self-rule that were earlier demanded by Indians.\\nThe offer in principle accepted the demand (or Constituent AssemblY\\nThe Viceroy at the time, Lord Linlithgow, made a fresh offer that promised —\\nI. Dominion Staus\\nII. The expansion o( the governor-general\\'s Executive Council to include more Indians\\nIII. The Establishment of an Advisory War counci/\\nIV. Giving full weight to minority opinion\\nV. Recognition of Indians\\' right to frame their own constitution (after the war would end), framed\\n’main/y’ by Indians.\\n\\n\\nIn return, it was hoped that all parties and communities in India would cooperate in Britain\\'s war \\nefforts.\\nHowever, the Congress as well as League rejected this offer, and Gandhi viewed it as having \\n\\'widened the gul( between Nationalist India and the British ru/er’ and he launched Individual \\nSatyagraha’ as result. Nehru reacted that — \\'Dominion Status is dead as door nail\\'.\\nHowever, this offer for the first time recognized right of Indians to frame their own constitution.\\nFurther, for the first time Dominion Status was expIicit!Y offered.\\nINDIVIDUAL SATYAGRAHA (1940)\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nBackground — In 1940, after refusal of August Offer, Congress was in a fix again. While some wanted \\nto organize a mass Civil Disobedience movementas they saw it as a right opportunity as Britain was \\nentangled in war, others — mainly Gandhi — wanted to go for Individual Satyagraha as he didn\\'t want \\nto take advantage of difficult situation of the British.\\nIts aim was to show that nationalist patience was not a sYmbol o( weakness and people made no \\ndifference between colonialism and Nazism. Further, it was a warning to government as well as \\ngiving it another opportunitiy.\\nThere were three people who were nominated by Gandhi himself as Individual satyagrahi. First was \\nAcharya Vinoba Bhave. He was arrested soon after he started it. Other two were Jawaharlal Nehru and \\nBrahama Dutt. They too were arrested. Individual Satyagraha was very limited and was withdrawn by \\nend of 1940. However it was relaunched in 1941 and this times it had some mass appeal and thousands \\nwere arrested.\\nCRIPPS MISSION (1942)\\nBackground - In 1939 the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, declared India a party to war without consulting \\nIndian political leaders or the elected provincial representatives. This caused considerable \\nresentment in India and provoked the resignation en masse of elected Congress PartY Provincial \\nGovernments in 1939 (which were elected in 1937), giving rise to the prospect o( public revolt and \\npolitical disorder in India. Government tried to reconcile with August Offer, but that was rejected \\nand instead Individual Satyagraha was launched. News that ’Atlantic Charter’ won\\'t be applicable to \\nIndians (which was signed between US and Britain and provided the (reedom to people to chose their \\nown government) further angered Indian leaders.\\nIt was another attempt in late March 1942 by the British government to secure Indian cooperation \\nand support for their efforts in World War II. The offer was made in a situation in which, Britain \\nwas pushed against the wall in wake of rising facism aggression —\\n•  As Japan approached towards Asia, British felt a need to garner support of British Indian Army.\\n•  There was also pressure (rom Allied forces to seek Indian cooperation.\\n\\n\\nPandit Nehru and Mulana Azad were official negotiators with the Cripps Mission. Cripps spent a \\nmajor chunk of his time in bringing congress and league on the same table. But, there was little \\nfrusf between the British and Congress by this stage, and both sides felt that the other was \\nconcealing its true plans.\\nMajor Features of Cripps Mission were (Almost same as August Offer) —\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nI. Dominion Status with later right to withdraw from Commonwealth\\nII. Reconstitution o( Viceroy’s Executive Council\\nIII. Constitutional Making Body (or India - Consisting of elected members of provinces and \\nrepresentatives from princely states\\nIV. War Executive Council — A war executive council was proposed having Indian representation, \\nhowever Defense of India will be retained by the government\\nV. Provinces may have separate Constitution\\n\\n\\nUnlike August offer, it gave offer o( Constitution making by Indians alone and not mainly’ by \\nIndians as proposed in August Offer. Secondly, it was given right to withdraw from Commonwealth. \\nFailure of Cripps Mission -\\nI. It spent most o{ the time in negotiations with Congress and League which remain adamant.\\nII. Viceroy and SecretarY ( State worked {rom behind to sabotage its egorts.\\nIII. Gandhi\\'s opposition led the Indian Nations/ Congress to reject the British offer,\\nIV. Cripps’ modification of the original British offer, which provided for no real transfer of \\npower and offered only Dominion Status which was rejected by Indians\\nV. Another major reason was the Cripps incapacitY to bargain, he was told to not go beyond the \\nboundaries of Draft Plan.\\nWhile the demand of Congress was of Independence, Gandhi said that Cripps\\'s offer of Dominion \\nstatus after the war was a ’Post dated cheque drawn on a crushing bank’.\\nMajor objections of Congress were dominion status. It also objected to the basis of nomination of \\nthe princely states through nomination and not by people themselves. Right of provinces to secede \\nalso went against plan of united India. Muslim League criticized idea of  single union. Depressed \\nfelt that partition wi/I leave them at the mercy o( Hindu and Mus/im majority elite.\\nQUIT INDIA (1942) or AUGUST KRANTI\\nBackground — Failure of August offer and Cripps Mission has left Indians with little choice and \\ngovernment has also shown repressive tendencies as witnessed in Individual Satyagraha.\\nGovernment was also adamant with its lame proposal of Dominion Status. There was a general price \\nrise and hardship for common man in wake of war. News of reversals suffered by British in War and \\nexpectations of its imminent collapse as the Imperial Japanese Army advanced closer to India with \\nthe conquest of Burma, Indians perceived an inability upon the part of the British to defend Indian \\nsoil.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen the British remained unresponsive, Gandhi and the Congress began planning a major public \\nrevolt, the Quit India movement — the first truly pan Indian mass movement. This period concurred \\nwith the rise of the Indian National Army, led bY Subhash Chandra Bose. The British response to the \\nQuit India movement was to throw most of the Congress leadership in jail. Jinnah took a separate \\nline and instead supported British and League even participated in proyincio/ elections.\\nIn the 8th August Bombay session, Congress passed the Quit India resolution at Gowalia Tank and its \\ndraft was prepared bY*^wahar Lal Nehru and seconded by Patel. Gandhi called for a ’Do or Die’ and \\ngave slogans of ’Quit /ndia’ and ’Bharat Choro’. Very next day of Gowalia Tank meet, major leaders \\nwere arrested under ’Operation Thunderbolt’ launched by the British.\\nCommon people showed unprecedented heroism, but they also faced unprecedented repression. On the \\nname of war, government had armed itself with draconian provisions and laws.\\nThere were other events like — Forcing people in Bengal and Orissa to restrict the use o( their \\nboats in (ear o(Japanese capture and use against British, news from South East were that British \\nonly evacuated white natives when Japanese Clttocked and thus leaving locals on thei fate.\\nThis lead to anger and confusion and people came on roads, hartaals ensued and clashes happened. \\nUnderground activities started and even porol/el governments were (ormed like the one in Satara. A \\nnew underground leadership emerged led by Achyut Patwardhan, R M Lohia, Sucheta Kriplani, \\nChhotubhai Puranik, R P Goenka and J P Narayan.\\nA new event happened in 1943, when Gandhi announced a 10 d«/ fast in Jai/ in response to British \\ngovernment\\'s exhortation to condemn the yio/ence committed by people. \\\\ nstead of condemning the \\nviolence, Gandhi fasted on. It raised public anger many a fold. He issued specific instructions to \\nvarious groups —\\nI. Government Servants — Don\\'t resign, but declare Y • allegiance to the Congress.\\nII. Soldiers — Don\\'t leave the army, but dOLl’t ire on yOUrcompatriots\\nII l. Students — I( con(ident leave the studies\\nIV. Peasants — If Zamindars are pro-government, don\\'t pay the rent. If they are anti government, \\npay.\\nV. Princes — Support the masses and accept the sovereignty of people.\\n\\n\\nTime movement was short lived, but signtftcant as it marked a new high in mass participation and \\nmade it amply clear to British that it will no longer be possible to suppress the masses. Students \\nand the peasantry served as the backbone, middle class and bureaucracy sided government.\\nSardar Vallabhai Patel was the most fervent supporter of Gandhi\\'s proposal for an all-out campaign \\nof civil disobedience during Quit India Movement. He participated in Gandhi\\'s call for individual\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\ndisobedience, and was arrested in 1940 and imprisoned for nine months. He also opposed the \\nproposals of the Cripps’ mission in 1942.\\nMuslim league after the Quit India came with its own ’Divide and Quit’ demand. Features of Quit \\nIndia Movement -\\nI. It was a spontaneous movement\\nII. It was not non-violent like earlier movements of Gandhi, it was first violent movement and the \\nlast one too launched by Gandhi. There were many incidences of violence\\nIII. It didn\\'t attract labor class in general\\nIV. Gandhi didn\\'t call for the government servants to leave their jobs but declare their support to \\nCongress. Similarly he asked army not to leave, but not fire on compatriots.\\n\\nPhases of Quit India Movement —\\nI. Urban Phase — Lasted for only one week\\nII. Rural Phase — Sabotage of government communication lines and transportation. It lasted for a \\nfew months around 3-4 months\\nIII. Under ground movement — it was the most violent and long lasting. All India Congress Radio was \\noperated by Usha Mehta. Asif Ali and Aruna Asif Ali trained everyone to operate multiple centers.\\nIV. Parallel Governments — Various parallel governments were formed —\\na. Balia, UP — Under Chittu Pandey\\nb. Tumluk, Bengal — Tamralipta National Government of Tumluk was different as it set up separate \\npolice, and revenue system. It also carried out relief work, supplied paddy from rich to poor. They \\nalso had an active Women\\'s Wing ’Bidyut Vahim’. Its major leaders were — Ajoy Kumar Mukharjee, \\nMatangini Hazara, Satish Chandra Samanta, Sushil Kumar Dhara.\\nc. Satara, Maharashtra — Under Achyut Patwardhan, YB Chavan, Nana Patil etc. Village libraries were \\nformed and Nyayadan Mandals were organized, prohibition campaigns were organized.\\nQuit India repression was one of the most violent repressions since repression of 1857. Around \\n10,000 people lost their lives.\\nIt made in a way final assertion of the will of people who were determined now not be held back by \\nany false promises.\\nC R FORMULA or RAJAJI FORMULA and GANDHI-JINNAH TALKS (1944)\\nBackground — Muslim League was intransigent on any issue of conciliation with Congress. Gandhi \\nwanted a united India and sought to break this deadlock and on C Rajaji\\'s inducement he got ready \\nfor talks. C Rajagopalachari proposed a formula (or C R formula or Rajaji formula) to solve the\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\npolitical deadlock between the All India Muslim League and Indian National Congress on independence \\nof India from the British. It was presented via a pamphlet \\'The WaY Out\\'.\\nIt offered the League the after independence, Pakistan based on plebiscite of ml/the peoples in the\\nregions where Mus/ims made a majority and in turn Muslim League should support the demand for \\nIndependence. This in some way g6ive approval (or separate Pakistan to which as per C Rajaji, \\nGandhi also agreed as formula had provision that after Independence if plebiscite called for a \\nseparate sovereign Pakistan, so it be.\\nAlthough the (ormula was opposed even within the Congress partY. Gandhi used it as his proposal in \\nhis talks with Jinnah in 1944. However, Jinnah rejected the proposal and the talks failed. Jinnah \\nrefused to accept the Rajaji Formula as Itdid not meet the League\\'s full demand for Pakistan. The \\nprovision of plebiscite in the (ormula didn\\'t go down well with the Muslim leaders. They agreed for \\nplebiscite only in some areas and not in ol/ places.\\nIn talks with Gandhi also, Candhi loathed the idea ofto separate nations which lead to their \\nfailure. Gandhi was adamant that any tats of p«tition should be held after British leave Inrfio \\nwhich was not acceptable to Jinnah.\\nHence, Jinnah rejected the initiative, telling his Council that it was intended to \\'torpedo\\' the \\n\\'Lahore resolution’; it was \\'grossest travesty\\', a \\'ridiculous proposal\\' and he termed it as — \\'a \\nshadow and a husk, maimed, mutilated Pakistan\\'.\\nDESAI-LIAQAT PACT\\nTo end the deadlock another attempt was made. Bhullabhi Desai and Liaqat Ali Khan came up with a\\ndra(t of forming an \\'interim government\\' at the center, consisting of —\\nl. Equal number o( representatives nominated bY League and Congress\\nII. 20% seats reserved for minorities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHIMLA CONFERENCE and WAVELL PLAN (1945)\\nAs the Gandhi-Jinnah talks over Rajaji formula failed, government offered another way to reconcile \\nthe differences between the two. The Shimla Conference was a 1945 meeting between Viceroy Wavell \\nand the major political leaders of /ndio at Simla, India to discuss composition of Viceroy\\'s \\nExecutive Council. Convened to agree on and approve the Wavell Plan for Indian self-government, it \\nreached a potential agreement for the set(-rule of Udio thot provided separate representation to \\nMuslims and reduced majority powers for both communities in their majority regions.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nHowever, talks stalled on the issue o(selection ofbus/imrepresentatives.The conference broke down \\non the insistence of Jinnah that his party should have an exc/usiye right to nominate Muslim \\nmembers o( the \\\\7iceroy’s Executive Council. This was something which the Congress could not \\nconcede without repudiating its national composition and saw this as an attempt to brand itself a \\ncaste Hindu party.\\nThis scuttled the conference, and perhaps the last viable opportunity for a united, independent \\nIndia. When the Indian National Congress and All India Muslim League reconvened under the Cabinet \\nMission the next year, the Indian National Congress was far less sympathetic to the Muslim League\\'s \\nrequests despite Jinnah\\'s approval of the British plan.\\nIn the meanwhile, Government changed in Britain and hostile Churchil was replaced by Clement Attlee \\nof Labor Party. Pethwick Lawrence became new secretary of state.\\nFurther, elections were held in 1945-46 in India too and both Muslim League and Congress won \\nheavily in their respective constituencies. This {urther bolstered the con(idence o( Muslim League. \\nINA and AZAD HIND FAUJ and INA TRIALS\\nINA was first formed by Mohan Singh and was later reorganized by Rash Behari Bose. Mohan Singh, \\nNiranjan Shah Gill and Mohammed Akram were the Indian expats who for the first time originally \\nformed INA with the help of Japan. However, later due to disagreement with Japanese, INA was \\ndisbanded and they were again made PoW.\\nRash Bihari Bose also contributed significantly to unite various local Indian Independence Leagues \\nin East Asian countries to form All India Independence League. Command of INA was given to Subhash \\nwhen he arrived in 1943.\\nSubhash formed a provisional government in Singapore and formed INA headquarters in Rangoon and \\nSingapore and he famously gave the call of \\'Delhi Chalo\\'. Netaji hoisted Indian flag in Andaman in \\nDecember 1943 and renamed the islands as — \\'Shahid\\' and \\'SwClrClj\\' in memory of martyrs.\\nIn 1944, INA started to advance along the eastern border and Kohima was taken. In the Imphal \\nCampaign one Indian battalion led by Shah Nawaz was also allowed to go along Japanese. However, the \\n(ailure of ! phal Campign and unequal treatment bY Japanese demoralized INA soldiers. With the \\nJapanese surrender in 1945, Azad Hind Fauj\\'s dream to liberate India was also shattered.\\nAfter surrender, famous INA trials at Red Fort took place in 1945-46. This saw massive rally of \\npeople and un-precedented emotional support for the brave patriots. Though the court martial held \\nfound the officers guilty, government under pressure released them. Trials garnered huge support \\ncutting across the community lines as one of the main leaders was Hindu, Prem Sehgal, one was \\nMuslim, Shah Nawaz Hussain and one a Sikh, Gurbaksh Singh DhiIIon.During war time, Indian Armies \\nwere\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nalso employed to restore French and Dutch colonies and this also fuelled anti-imperialist \\nsentiments as Britain on one hand was talking independence on the other hand was promoting \\ncolonialism.\\nIn Calcutta, an INA officer Rashid Ali was sentenced for 7 years and this caused much anger.\\nIn June 1944, with the end of the war in sight, Gandhiji was released from prison. Later that year \\nhe held a series of meetings with Jinnah, seeking to bridge the gap between the Congress and the \\nLeague.\\nThe prevailing conditions made it amply clear to the British that holding India away from \\nIndependence will no londer be feasible in a post war arena because —\\n•  It has grown weak\\n• Peer pressure from US and Russia\\n• Signals from INA for other possible armed struggles\\n•  Final straw came by RIN mutiny, which proved that army which used to be the stronghold of Britsh \\ncannot remain insulated to national events, further strike by Signals Corps at Jabalpur also \\nindicated similar things. These events broke the notion of loyal-Indians and they realized that \\nIndians can no longer be relied for administrative work\\n\\nIn 1945, a Labour government came to power in Britain under prime minister Clement Attlee and \\ncommitted itself to granting independence to India. Meanwhile, back in India, the Viceroy, Lord \\nWavell, brought the Congress and the League together for a series of talks. Elections took place \\nwith separate electorate and both Muslim league and congress participated and both recorded \\noverwhelming majority in their respective reserved seats. And it made the political polarization \\ncomplete, which culminated in the partition.\\nRIN RATING MUTINY (1946)\\nIt started with an incident when a sailor on board o( INS Talwar wrote ’Quit India’ and he was \\narrested for this, however causes were deep rooted. Racil discrimination, unpalatable (ood, poor \\nworking conditions, abuse bYsenior o((icers, /NA trials were the causes.\\nThe Royal Indian Navy mutiny (also called the Bombay Mutiny) encompasses a total strike and \\nsubsequent mutiny by Indian sailors of the Royal Indian Navy on board ship and shore establishments \\nat Bombay (Mumbai) harbour on 18 February 1946. From the initial flashpoint in Bombay, the mutiny \\nspread and found support throughout British India, from Karachi to Calcutta and ultimately came to \\ninvolve 78 ships, 20 shore establishments and 20,000 sailors.\\nIt was repressed by force by the British Royal Navy. ^!Y he Communist Party supported the \\nstrikers,-\\nthe Congress and the Muslim League condemned it.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTwo interpretations of movement —\\nI. Revolt for Freeedom — Nationalist historians on the far left have looked at the mutiny as a \\nrevolt against the British Raj and imperial rule.\\nII. Revolt against Bad Condition of Sailors - However naval historians argue that internal \\nconditions in the Royal Indian Navy were more important sources of unrest.\\n\\nNotably, the mutinying ships hoisted three (lags tied together — those of the Congress, Muslim \\nLeague, and the Red Flag of the Communist Party of India (CPI), signifying the unity and \\ndemarginalisation of communal issues among the mutineers.\\nRallies were organized in support of mutineers, food and essential items were sent on ships, \\nhartals were organized.\\nThe mutiny was called off following a meeting between the President of the Naval Central Strike \\nCommittee (NCSC) and Vallabh Bhai Patel of the Congress, who had been sent to Bombay to settle the \\ncrisis. Patel issued a statement calling on the strikers to end their action, which was later \\nechoed by a statement issued in Calcutta by Mohammed Ali Jinnah on behalf of the Muslim League.\\nThe mutiny was significant because till thot day there has been no revolt from the armed forces and \\nthis had a moral effect on masses and it electrified the whole nation. It prompted British \\ngovernment to treat /NA prisioners with lineoncy and only those who were accused of murder, and \\nbrutal crime were put to trio/. Soon Cabinet Mission also followed.\\nPOST SECOND WORLD WAR\\nIn post world war time, Indians have revealed their heroic tendencies during Quit India and INA. \\nNew struggle took place in the form of massive movement against onviction of INA soldiers. Under \\nenormous pressure, government set them free.\\nChange in attitude of government in post war period was because of —\\nI. Power equation changed in post war period and both USA and Russia supported cause of \\nindependence of colonies including India.\\nII. War caused huge economic drain on Britain\\nIII. There was a government change in Britain and Labor party won elections. Hostile Churchil was \\nreplaced by a more pragmatic Clemen Attlee who supported Indian cause.\\nIV. British soldiers were haggard after war and were not willing on further foreign jaunts.\\nV. British faith in Indian army and administrative machinery was also broken after RIN mutiny and \\nSignals corps at Jabalpur.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nVI. Congress as well as Muslim League performed well in provincial elections giving boost to \\nsupport for domestic rule.\\n\\nCABINET MISSION (1946)\\nAfter failure of Gandhi-Jinnha talks (1944) and Wavell plan (1945) Cabinet Mission was sent to \\nIndia to —\\nI. Discuss the formation of interim government and outline of future government\\nII. Setting up of a constituent assembly.\\nCabinet mission stood for united India. It was a last opportunity to ovoid portition. Its members \\nwere —Cripps, Pathwick Lawrence, Alexender\\nAttitude of British Government was now considerably changed due to following reasons —\\n•  War wearied awaY UK and it was no more a global superpower.\\n•  New Labor government was more sympathetic to Indian demands.\\n•  There was an anti-imperialist wave in South East Asia.\\n•  British soldiers were haggard and econOmY in a shambles.\\n•  RIN mutiny was a strong signal that Indians will no longer subjugate to imperial oppression\\n\\n\\nA Cabinet Mission sent in the summer of 1946 (ailed to get the Congress and the League to agree on \\na (ederal system that would keep India together while allowing the provinces a degree of autonomy. \\nThe Cabinet Mission toured the country for three months and recommended a loose three-tier \\nconfederation. \\\\ ndia was to remain united. It was to have a weak centra/ government controlling \\nonly foreign affairs, defence and communications with the existing provincial assemblies being \\ngrouped into three groups. Initially all the major parties accepted this plan. It made following \\nproposals initially —\\nI. A united Dominion of India would be given independence with opt-out clause.\\nII. Formation of a Constituent Assembly\\nIII. There will be compulsory grouping with three groups.\\n•  Muslim-majority provinces would be grouped in two groups (Group B and C) — Baluchistan, Sind, \\nPunjab and North-West Frontier Province would form one group, and Bengal and Assam would form \\nanother.\\n•  Hindu-majority provinces in central and southern India would form another group (Group A).\\nIV. The central government would be empowered to run foreign affairs, defence and communications, \\nwhile the rest o( powers and responsibilitY WOLlId belong to the provinces,\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\ncoordinated by groups. (this provision lend a truly federal structure, which was not acceptable to \\ncenter leaning congress)\\nV. Princly states will no longer be under Crown and they will be free to join the successor or \\ncontinue their relations with Britain.\\n\\nJune 16 Plan — Congress rejected the concept of grouping - while League was vouching for compulsory \\ngrouping, Congress wanted a choice (or provinces to join anY grouping — as well as power to \\nprovinces and in this wake a revision was made which envisaged separate states (or Hindus and \\nMuslims and a choice for provinces to take any o( the sides (Though British suggest that that \\ninitially only provinces will be grouped compulsorily, later on after formation of constitution, \\nthey will be free to get out of their grouping to other grouping. But Congress rejected it).\\nCongress later ruled out the June 16 plan also calling it divisive. However Muslim League agreed to \\nit.\\nElections of Constituent Assembly in 1946 resulted in huge Congress majority which Jinnah termed as \\n‘Brute Majority’. This further stoked Muslim League\\'s apprehensions of Congress dominance in \\npartition and it led to demand for separate nation which was rejected by Congress. The rejection o( \\ncabinet mission plan combined with recent Constituent Assembly results led to a resurgence o( \\ncon{rontationa/ politics beginning with the Muslim League\\'s call for general strike known as’Direct \\naction day’ and they called for — ‘Lekar rahenge Pakistan, Larkar lenge Pakisatan’.\\nThis led to confrontation on the day and subsequent communal riots and Bihar killings. Only Mahatma \\nGandhi and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan of the NWFP continued to firmly oppose the idea of partition.\\nIn a last bid, Wavell was replaced by Mounbetton for last round of talks, but that too failed. Out \\nof senior Congress Leaders, it was Patel who was in favor of the Mountbetton Plan.\\nDIRECT ACTION DAY and NOAKHALI MASSACRE (1946)\\nSince 1940 when the Muslim League raised the Pakistan proposal at its Lahore convention, it had \\nadopted an increasingly hostile attitude. Talks after talks failed including Cripps Mission talks, \\nCR Formula (Gandhi Jinnah Talks), Desai-Liaquat Pact and finally Cabinet Mission. In the 1946, the \\nMuslim League contested the elections on the plank of Pakistan, and an overwhelming 97% of the \\nMuslim population of Bengal voted for Muslim League, but it also resulted in huge Congress majority \\nwhich Jinnah termed as ‘Brute Majority’. This further stoked Muslim League\\'s apprehensions o( \\nCongress dominance in partition. The Muslim League re(used to accept the Cabinet Mission plan and\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nalso re(used to join the Interim Government or Constituent Assembly. Congress on the other hand \\nrejected the demand (or a separate state (or Muslims.\\nThe rejection of cabinet mission plan combined with recent Constituent Assembly row led to a \\nresurgence of confrontational politics beginning with the Muslim League\\'s ‘Direct action day’ (16 \\nAugust 1946) as a general strike in Calcutta and they called for — ‘Lekar rahenge Pakistan, Larkar \\nlenge Pakisatan’.\\nOn that day meeting would be held all over the country to explain League\\'s resolution. In Bengal, \\nthe only Muslim League ruled province in British India, the day was declared a public hoIid^Y \\nHowever things turned ugly on the day of strike after initial skirmeshes between the two \\ncommunities.\\nKolkata witnessed an unprecedented mass violence in the next five days, leaving 4,000 dead. \\nViolence in Calcutta sparked off further religious riots in the surrounding regions of Noakhali, \\nBihar, United Province (modern Uttar Pradesh), Punjab, and the North Western Frontier Province. \\nThese events sowed the seeds for the eventual Partition o( /ndio.\\nNoakhali genocide was a series of massacres, rapes, abductions and forced conversions of Hindus and \\nloot and arson of Hindu properties, perpetrated by the Muslim community in the districts of Muslim \\ndominated Noakhali and Tipperah in the Chittagong Division of Bengal in October— November 1946. \\nGandhi, camped in Noakhali for four months and toured the district in a mission to restore peace \\nand communal harmony.\\nMOUNTBATTEN PLAN (1947) or 3rd JUNE PLAN\\nBackground — The failure of the Cabinet Mission was followed by the collapse o( the interim \\nGovernment. Furthermore, by the end of 1946 communal violence increased in the country and the \\nBritish (eared thof /ndia wou/d seftle {or a civi/ war. In such a tumultuous situation, Lord \\nMountbatten replaced Lord Wavell as Viceroy of India in 1947.\\nMountbatten\\'s formula was to divide India and at the same time retain maximum possible unity. The \\nactual division between the two new dominions of India and Pakistan was accomplished according to \\nwhat has come to be known as the 3rd June Plan or Mountbatten Plan. It was announced at a press \\nconference by Mountbatten on 4 June 1947, and the date of independence was also announced — 15 \\nAugust 1947. The main points of the plan were —\\nI. Partition — Muslim-dominated areas may be separated to form a Dominion. In that case such \\ndomination would be constituted by a partition of Bengal and the Punjab Hindus and Muslims in \\nPunjab and Bengal legislative assemblies would meet and vote for partition. If a simple majority of \\neither group wanted partition, then these provinces would be divided.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nII. Referendum for NWFP and Sylhet - The fate of North West Frontier Province and Sylhet district \\nof Bengal was to be decided by a referendum.\\nIII. India would be free by 15th August 1947.\\nIV. Princly States — Independence o(princely states was ruled out. They would either join India or \\nPakistan. Independence for Bengal also ruled out.\\nV. A boundary commission to be set up in case of partition.\\n\\n\\nThe Muslim league\\'s demand o( a separate state was thus conceded. Congress’ position on unity was \\nalso taken into account while integrating the princely states to India.\\nGandhi and Azad had been totally opposed to Mounbatten Plan as it confirmed the division of \\ncountry.\\nINDIA INDEPENDENCE ACT (1947)\\nIndian Independence Act was passed in July 1947, which specified the following —\\nI. The British rule of India should be over on the midnight of August 15, 1947.\\nII. An independent dominion of India shall be created out of the United Provinces, Central \\nProvinces, Bombay Presidency, Madras Presidency, the Carnatic, East Punjab, West Bengal, Assam and \\nthe Northeast Frontier Agency. The territories of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the \\nLakshadweep Islands are also turned over to the Indian Dominion.\\nIII. An independent dominion of Pakistan shall be created out of the provinces of West Punjab, \\nNorth West Frontier Province, Sindh and East Bengal.\\nIV. The all Princely states that were officially related to British Empire were made free from all \\nthe treaties and relationships and they could decide which dominion to join.\\nV. Both the Indian and Pakistan Dominions would be members of the British Commonwealth and was \\nallowed to leave whenever they pleased.\\nVI. Both Dominions of India and Pakistan were completely self-governing in their internal affairs, \\nforeign affairs and national security but the British monarch will continue to be their head of \\nstate, represented by the Governor-General of India and a new Governor-General of Pakistan.\\n\\nPARTITION AND THE EVENTS LEADING TO IT\\nRight after the first rebellion of 1857, a section of Muslims Syed Ahmed Khan felt that Muslims are \\nnot getting due representation in India in every field.\\nI. Muslim League — Muslim League was founded in 1906.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nII. Separate Electorate — It is argued that separate electorate of 1909 was one of the major acts \\nthat deepened the rift between Hindu and Muslims.\\nIII. Lucknow Session of 1916 — It defacto gave consent to separate electorate.\\nIV. Non-Partition in Civil Disobedience — Participation of Muslims in Civil Disobedience, 1930, was \\nnegligible\\nV. Demand of Autonomous Region — Iqbal for the first time in 1930 put forward demand of an \\nautonomous region for the Muslims\\nVI. Pakistan — Rehmat Ali a Cambridge scholar coined the term Pakistan in 1933 (Punjab, Afghaistan, \\nKashmir, Sindh, Baluchistan)\\nVII. Congress Attitude in 1937 Elections — In 1937 elections after gaining majority, Congress \\ndenied forming coalition with League\\nVIII. Lahore Session and ‘Two Nation Theory’ — 1940 — The Lahore Session of League passed a \\nresolution with Theory of Two Nations.\\nIX. Divide and Quit — While Congress called for Quit India, League called for ‘Divide and Quit’ in \\n1942\\nX. Direct Action Day, 1946 — Muslim League called a general strike in August 1946 and called it \\nDirect Action Day. Foreign government instead of curbing the riots that ensued after call of Direct \\nAction Day rather encouraged these by their divisive policies perhaps to play the two newly \\nindependent states against each other.\\nXI. Religious Angle — The efforts of the Arya Samaj to bring back to the Hindu fold (shuddhi) those \\nwho had recently converted to Islam irked Muslims. Hindus were angered by the rapid spread of \\ntabligh (propaganda) and tanzim (organisation) after 1923.Other developments like Hindu groups like \\nHindu Mahasabha (1915), RSS, celeberation of Hindu festivals etc further reinforced the Hindu \\nIdentity.\\nXII. In the end, the secular and radical rhetoric of the Congress merely alarmed conservative \\nMuslims and the Muslim landed elite, without winning over the Muslim masses.\\n\\nGandhi\\'s Bid to Restore Peace — He moved to villages of East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) to the \\nvillages of Bihar and then to the riot-torn slums of Calcutta and Delhi, in a heroic effort to stop \\nHindus and Muslims kill each other, careful everywhere to reassure the minority community. In \\nOctober 1946, Muslims in East Bengal targeted Hindus. Gandhiji visited the area, toured the \\nvillages on foot, and persuaded the local Muslims to guarantee the safety of Hindus. Similarly \\nGandhi persuaded Hindus to refrain from violence in other parts like Delhi. He held a fast in Delhi \\nwhich\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nmade many to change their hearts and minds. However, the streak of hatred could be ended only with \\nthe martyrdom of Gandhi.\\nPOST INDEPENDENCE\\nApproximately one third of the total area was under princely states when India got independent. A \\nbig challenge was to integrate them into Indian union. With efforts of Vallabhai Patel most of them \\nbecame part of India. Only three — Junagarh, Hyderabad and Kashmir didn\\'t join. They were later \\nintegrated by various methods.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nINDIAN CULTURE\\n\\n1. Religions\\n\\nReligion has been an important part of India\\'s culture throughout its history. Religious diversity \\nand religious\\n\\ntolerance are both established in the country by law and custom. A vast majority of Indians (over \\n93%) associate\\n\\nthemselves with a religion. Four of the world\\'s major religious traditions; Hinduism, Buddhism, \\nJainism and Sikhism\\n\\nare originated at India. These religions are also called as ‘Eastern Religions’.\\n\\n1. Hinduism\\n\\nThe word Hindu is derived from the Sanskrit name Sindhu for the Indus River. With around 1 billion \\nfollowers,\\n\\nHinduism is the third largest religion in the world after Christianity and Islam. Hinduism is \\nconsidered as the oldest\\n\\nreligion of the World originating around 5000 years ago. It is the predominant spiritual following \\nof the Indian\\n\\nsubcontinent, and one of its indigenous faiths. Hinduism is a conglomeration of distinct \\nintellectual or philosophical\\n\\npoints of view, rather than a rigid common set of beliefs. Hinduism was spread through parts of \\nSouth- eastern Asia,\\n\\nChina, Korea, and Japan. Hindus worship a god with different forms.\\n\\nEvolution\\n\\nThe origin of Hinduism dates back to prehistoric times. Some of the important evidences of \\nprehistoric times:\\n\\n• Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals gives evidence attesting to prehistoric \\nreligion in\\n\\nthe Indian \"subcontinent\".\\n\\n• Neolithic pastoralists inhabiting the Indus River Valley buried their dead in a manner suggestive \\nof spiritual practices that incorporated notions of an afterlife and belief in magic.\\n• Other Stone Age sites, such as the Bhimbetka rock shelters in central Madhya Pradesh and the \\nKupgal\\n\\npetroglyphs of eastern Karnataka, contain rock art portraying religious rites and evidence of \\npossible ritualised music.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n• The people of the Indus Valley Civilization, centered around the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra river \\nvalleys,\\n\\nmay have worshiped an important mother goddess symbolising fertility.\\n\\n• Excavations of Indus Valley Civilization sites show seals with animals and \"fire -altars\", \\nindicating rituals\\nassociated with fire. A linga-yoni of a type similar to that which is now worshiped by Hindus has \\nalso\\n\\nbeen found.\\n\\n• The oldest surviving text of Hinduism is the Rigveda, produced during the Vedic period (1700—1100\\n\\nBCE). The Vedas center on worship of deities such as Indra, Varuna and Agni, and on the Soma \\nritual.\\n\\nFire-sacrifices, called yajña are performed by chanting Vedic mantras chanted but no temples or \\nidols\\n\\nare known.\\n\\n• The earliest versions of the epic poems Ramayana and Mahabharata were written roughly from \\n500—100\\n\\nBCE.\\n\\n• After 200 BC, several schools of thought were formally codified in Indian philosophy, including \\nSamkhya,\\n\\nYoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Purva-Mimamsa and Vedanta.\\n\\n• The 9th and 8th centuries BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads. Upanishads \\nform\\n\\nthe theoretical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Veda). In \\nHinduism, Brahman is the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the \\nphenomenal universe. Brahman is conceived as personal (”with qualities”), impersonal (\"without \\nqualities”) and/or supreme depending on the philosophical school.\\nBrahman should not be confused with Brahmin\\n\\nHindu Denominations\\n\\nHindu philosophy is traditionally divided into six âstika (orthodox) schools of thought, or \\ndarsanan,\\nwhich accept\\n\\nthe Vedas as supreme revealed scriptures. The âstika schools are:\\n\\n1. &  a, an atheistic and strongly dualist theoretical exposition of consciousness and matter.\\n\\n2. Pcg¥z, a school emphasizing meditation, contemplation and liberation.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n3.  a  or logic, explores sources of knowledge (Nyaya Sutras).\\n\\n4. Idrs zzsT4a, an empiricist school of atomism.\\n\\n5. ///ua as/, an anti-ascetic and anti-mysticist school of orthopraxy.\\n\\n6. Idx¥zz \\'a, the last segment of knowledge in the Vedas, or the ’Jnan\\' (knowledge) \\'Kanda\\' \\n(section).\\n\\nVedanta came to be the dominant current of Hinduism in the post-medieval period.\\n\\nOf the historical division into six darsanas, only two schools, Vedanta and Yoga, survive.\\n\\n1. Samkhya\\n\\nSamkhya is the oldest of the orthodox philosophical systems in Hinduism. It espouses dualism \\nbetween\\n\\nconsciousness and matter by postulating two \"irreducible, innate and independent\" realities:\\n\\n(i) Consciousness itself or Purusha (self, atma or soul)\\n\\n(ii) Primordial materiality or Prakriti (creative agency or energy).\\n\\n2Prakriti consists of varying levels of three dispositions or categories of qualities: Activity \\n(zztas), Inactivity (/‘aws)\\n\\nand Harmony (salt ). An imbalance in the intertwined relationship of these three dispositions \\ncauses the world to\\n\\nevolve from Prakriti. This evolution from Prakriti causes the creation of 23 constituents, \\nincluding intellect (buddhi),\\n\\nego (ahamkara) and mind (manas). Samkhya theorizes the existence of many living souls (Jeevatmas) \\nwho\\n\\npossess consciousness, but denies the existence of Ishvara(God).\\n\\nSamkhya holds that Purusa, the eternal pure consciousness, due to ignorance, identifies itself with \\nproducts of\\n\\nPrakriti such as intellect (buddhi) and ego (ahamkara). This results in endless transmigration and \\nsuffering.\\n\\nHowever, once the realization arises that Purusa is distinct from Prakriti, the Self is no longer \\nsubject to\\n\\ntransmigration and absolute freedom (kaivalya) arises.\\n\\n2. Yoga\\n\\nThe Yoga philosophical system is closely allied with the Samkhya school, but is more theistic than \\nthe Samkhya.\\n\\nThe foundational text of the Yoga school is the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, who is regarded as the \\nfounder of the\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nformal Yoga philosophy. Hindu philosophy distinguishes seven major branches of Yoga:\\n\\n(i) PdJa Yoga (Classical Yoga), a system of yoga codified by Patañjali and classified as one of the \\nsix âstika (\"orthodox\") schools of Hindu philosophy.\\n(ii) Jzzyze cgzt, (buddhi-yoga) centred on the faculty of discernment and ’virtually identical with \\nthe spiritual\\npath of Vedânta’.\\n\\n(iii) 7 zrm- cgst, in which the world of everyday work becomes the tool by which self is \\ntranscended.\\n\\n(iv) 7¥z Y/- Fcgzz the path of devoted service to God.\\n\\n(v) Tax \\'ra-j<gezfocused on the techniques and psycho-physical teachings contained within a body of \\ntexts\\ncalled tantras.\\n\\n(vi) dzzrza- cgzz, one of the most ancient forms of yoga in which the psycho-acoustical properties \\nof the\\n\\nspoken word are used to concentrate the mind.\\n\\n(vii) 7 /’&   , a system of physical purification designed to reintegrate and re-balance the mind \\nand body\\nin preparation for Raja-yoga (first described by Yogi Swatmarama).\\n\\n3. Nyaya\\n\\nThe Nyaya school is based on the Nyaya Sutras. They were written by Aksapada Gautama, probably in \\nthe second\\n\\ncentury BCE. The most important contribution made by this school is its methodology. This \\nmethodology is based\\n\\non a system of logic that has subsequently been adopted by the majority of the Indian schools.\\n\\nThe followers of Nyaya believed that obtaining valid knowledge was the only way to gain release \\nfrom suffering.\\n\\nAccording to Nyaya, there are exactly four sources of knowledge: perception, inference, comparison, \\nand\\n\\ntestimony. Knowledge obtained through each of these is either valid or invalid.\\n\\n4. Vaisheshika\\n\\nThe Vaisheshika school postulates an atomic pluralism in which all objects in the physical universe \\nare reducible to\\n\\ncertain types of atoms, and Brahman is regarded as the fundamental force that causes consciousness \\nin these\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\natoms. The school was founded by the sage Kanâda (or Kana-bhuk, literally, atom-eater) around the \\n2nd century\\n\\nBC. Major ideas contained in the Vaisheshika Sutra are:\\n\\n• There are nine classes of realities: four classes of atoms (earth, water, light and air), space \\n(akasha), time\\n(kâla), direction (dik), infinity of souls (Atman), mind (manas).\\n\\n• Individual souls are eternal and pervade material body for a time.\\n\\n• There are seven categories (padârtha) of experience: substance, quality, activity, generality, \\nparticularity,\\n\\ninherence and non-existence.\\n\\nAlthough the Vaisheshika school developed independently from the Nyaya, the two eventually merged \\nbecause of\\n\\ntheir closely related metaphysical theories. In its classical form, however, the Vaisheshika school \\ndiffered from the\\n\\nNyaya in one crucial respect: where Nyaya accepted four sources of valid knowledge, the Vaisheshika \\naccepted\\n\\nonly two  perception and inference.\\n\\n5. Purva Mimansa\\n\\nThe main objective of the Purva Mimamsa school was to establish the authority of the Vedas.\\nConsequently, this\\n\\nschool\\'s most valuable contribution to Hinduism was its formulation of the rules of Vedic \\ninterpretation.\\nIts\\n\\nadherents propounded unquestionable faith in the Vedas and regular performance of the yajñas, or \\nfire-sacrifices.\\n\\nThey believed in the power of the mantras and yajñas to sustain all the activity of the universe. \\nIn keeping with this\\n\\nbelief, they placed great emphasis on dharma, which consisted of the performance of Vedic rituals.\\n\\nThe Mimamsa philosophers believed that the other schools of thought that aimed for release (moksha) \\nwere not\\n\\nallowed for complete freedom from desire and selfishness, because the very striving for liberation \\nstemmed from a\\n\\nsimple desire to be free. According to Mimamsa thought, only by acting in accordance with the \\nprescriptions of the\\n\\nVedas may one attain salvation. Although Mimamsa does not receive much scholarly attention, its \\ninfluence can be\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nfelt in the life of the practising Hindu, because all Hindu ritual, ceremony, and law is influenced \\nby this school.\\n\\n\\n6. Vedanta\\n\\nThe Vedanta, or later Mimamsa school, concentrates on the philosophical teachings of the Upanishads \\nrather than\\n\\nthe ritualistic injunctions of the Brahmanas. These were mystical aspects of Vedic religion that \\nfocused on\\n\\nmeditation, self-discipline, and spiritual connectivity, more than traditional ritualism. Vedanta \\nmeans, the last\\n\\nsegment of knowledge in the Vedas. While, the earlier segments of the Vedas are called \\'Karma \\nKanda\\'. Parts of\\n\\nVedas that focus on spiritual practices such as worship, devotion and meditation are called \\n\\'Upasana Kanda\\'.\\n\\n(Kanda = section).\\n\\nVedantic thought drew on Vedic cosmology, hymns and philosophy. While thirteen or so Upanishads are \\naccepted\\nas principal, over a hundred exist. The most significant contribution of Vedantic thought is the \\nidea that selfconsciousness\\n\\nis continuous with and indistinguishable from consciousness of Brahman.\\n\\nThe principles of the Vedanta sutras are presented in a cryptic, poetic style, which allows for a \\nvariety of\\n\\ninterpretations. Consequently, the Vedanta separated into six sub-schools, each interpreting the \\ntexts\\nin its own\\n\\nway and producing its own series of sub-commentaries.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the oldest and most widely acknowledged Vedantic school. Advaita means \"non-duality.\" Its \\nfirst great consolidator was Adi Shankaracharya\\nAccording to Advaita, Brahman is the only reality, and there exists nothing whatsoever which is not\\n\\nBrahman. The appearance of dualities and differences in this world is a superimposition on Brahman, \\ncalled Maya. Maya is neither existent nor non-existent, but appears to exist temporarily.\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen a person tries to know Brahman through his mind, due to the influence of Maya, Brahman appears\\nas God (Ishvara), separate from the world and from the individual. In reality, there is no \\ndifference between\\n\\nthe individual soul (Jivatma) and Brahman (Paramatma).\\n\\nThe spiritual practices such as: devotion to God, meditation & self-less action etc. purifies the \\nmind and\\nindirectly helps in perceiving the real.\\n\\nThe only direct cause of liberation is self-knowledge which directly removes the ignorance. After \\nrealization, one sees one\\'s own self and the Universe as the same\\n\\n\\nVishishtadvaita is means qualified non-dualism. Ramanujacharya was the foremost proponent of the\\nphilosophy of Vishishtadvaita.\\n\\nVishishtadvaita advocated the concept of a Supreme Being with essential qualities or attributes.\\nThey are\\n\\nagainst the Advaitan philosophy of Brahman as an impersonal empty oneness.\\n\\nThey saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was \\nomnipresent\\nand actively involved in existence. To them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and \\na sign\\n\\nof ignorance. However, the individual\\'s sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was \\nderived from\\n\\nthe universal beingness that is Brahman. Ramanuja He saw Vishnu as a personification of Brahman.\\n\\n\\n\\nDvaita Vedanta means the dualistic conclusions of the Vedas. This philosophy was founded by \\nMadhvacharya. It propagates the principle of dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate \\nrealities.\\nThe first and the more important reality is that of Vishnu or Brahman. Vishnu is the supreme Self, \\nGod, the\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nabsolute truth of the universe, the independent reality.\\n\\nThe second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate \\nessence.\\n\\nThe distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to Advaita Vedanta (monistic conclusion of \\nVedas)\\nis that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls \\nthe universe.\\nDvaita philosophy attempts to address the problem of evil with the idea that souls are not created.\\n\\nBecause the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections of \\nthe\\n\\ndivine, but never in any way identical with the divine. Salvation therefore is described as the \\nrealization that\\n\\nall finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.\\n\\n\\n\\nDvaitadvaita was proposed by Nimbarka.\\n\\nAccording to this philosophy there are three categories of existence: Brahman, soul, and matter.\\nSoul and\\n\\nmatter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from \\nBrahman.\\n\\nBrahman exists independently, while soul and matter are dependent yet seperate. Further,\\nBrahman is a\\n\\ncontroller, the soul is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed.\\n\\nThe highest object of worship is Krishna and his consort Radha, attended by thousands of gopis,\\nor\\n\\ncowherdesses; of the celestial Vrindavana; and devotion consists in self-surrender.\\n\\n\\n\\nShuddhadvaita is the \"purely non-dual\" philosophy propounded by Vallabhacharya.\\n\\nThe Shuddhadvaita principle sees equality in \"essence\" of the individual self with God. There is no\\nreal\\n\\ndifference between the two. It does not deny God as the whole and the individual as the part. The\\n\\nindividual soul is not the Supreme (Satcitananda) clouded by the force of avidya, but is itself \\nBrahman, with\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\none attribute (ananda) rendered imperceptible.\\n\\nUnlike Advaita, the world of Maya is not regarded as unreal, since Maya is nothing else than a\\npower of\\n\\nIshvara. He is not only the creator of the universe but is the universe itself.\\n\\nThe followers of Shuddhadvaita are the worshipers of Krishna. They maintain that if one wants to \\nobtain\\nmoksha and the bliss given by Krishna, the only path to do so is bhakti.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the philosophy of \"inconceivable oneness and difference\" in relation to the power creation \\nand\\ncreator, (Krishna) and also between God and his energies within the Gaudiya Vaishnava religious \\ntradition.\\n\\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu was the founder of this philosophy. He was stating that the soul or energy of \\nGod\\nis both distinct and non-distinct from God, whom he identified as Krishna, Govinda, and that this, \\nalthough\\n\\nunthinkable, may be experienced through a process of loving devotion (bhakti).\\n\\nThree other nâstika (heterodox) schools don\\'t draw upon the Vedas as the sole primary authoritative \\ntext, but may\\nemphasize other traditions of thought. The nâstika schools are:\\n\\n1. Cârvâka\\n\\n2. Jainism\\n\\n3. Buddhism\\n\\nWhile Charvaka is classified as a nâstika school, Buddhism and Jainism are also classified as \\nnâstika religions\\n\\nsince they do not accept the authority of the Vedas.\\n\\n\\n\\nHinduism, otherwise a highly theistic religion, hosted atheistic schools; the thoroughly \\nmaterialistic and antireligious\\nphilosophical Cârvâka (Nastika) school that originated in India around the 6th century BCE is \\nprobably the most explicitly atheistic school of Indian philosophy. It is not included among the \\nsix schools of\\nHinduism\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\ngenerally regarded as orthodox. Our understanding of Cârvâka philosophy is fragmentary, based \\nlargely on\\n\\ncriticism of the ideas by other schools, and it is no longer a living tradition.\\n\\nAcademics categorize contemporary Hinduism into four major denominations: Vaishnavism,\\nShaivism, Smartism\\n\\nand Shaktism. The denominations differ primarily in the god worshipped as the Supreme One and in \\nthe traditions\\nthat accompany worship of that god.\\n\\nVaishnavas worship Vishnu as the supreme God; Shaivites worship Shiva as the supreme; Shaktas \\nworship Shakti\\n\\n(power) personified through a female divinity or Mother Goddess, Devi; while Smartas believe in the \\nessential\\n\\noneness of five (panchadeva) or six (Shanmata, as Tamil Hindus add Skanda) deities as \\npersonifications of the\\n\\nSupreme.\\n\\n1. Vaishnavism\\n\\nIt is focused on worshiping of Vishnu. Vaishnavites lead a way of life promoting differentiated \\nmonotheism,\\nwhich gives importance to Lord Vishnu and His ten incarnations.\\n\\nIts beliefs and practices, especially the concepts of Bhakti and Bhakti Yoga, are based largely on \\nthe\\nUpanishads, and associated with the Vedas and Puranic texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, and the \\nPadma, Vishnu and Bhagavata Puranas.\\nAwareness, recognition, and growth of the belief have significantly increased outside of India in \\nrecent\\nyears. The Gaudiya Vaishnava branch of the tradition has significantly increased the awareness of \\nVaishnavism internationally, since the mid-1900s, largely through the activities and geographical \\nexpansion of the Hare Krishna movement founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in New York \\nCity in 1966.\\n2. Shaivism\\n\\nShaivism reveres the god Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, \\nthe\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\ncreator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is.\\n\\nDevotees of Shiva wear Sacred ash as a sectarian mark on their foreheads and other parts of their\\nbodies\\n\\nwith reverence. The Sanskrit words bhasma and vibhuti can both be translated as \"sacred ash\".\\n\\nShaivism has a vast literature that includes texts representing multiple philosophical schools, \\nincluding\\nnon-dualist (abheda), dualist (bheda), and non-dual-with-dualism (bhedâbheda) perspectives.\\n\\n\\n3. Shaktism\\n\\nShaktism focuses focuses worship upon Shakti or Devi — the Hindu Divine Mother —as the absolute,\\nultimate Godhead. Shaktism regards Dev as the Supreme Brahman itself, with all other forms of \\ndivinity,\\n\\nfemale or male, considered being merely her diverse manifestations.\\n\\nIn the details of its philosophy and practice, Shaktism resembles Shaivism. However, Shaktas focus \\nmost\\nor all worship on Shakti, as the dynamic feminine aspect of the Supreme Divine.\\n\\nShaktism is practiced throughout the Indian subcontinent and beyond, in numerous forms, both \\nTantric and\\n\\nnon-Tantric; however, its two largest and most visible schools are the Srikula (lit., family of \\nSri), strongest\\n\\nin South India, and the Kalikula (family of Kali), which prevails in northern and eastern India.\\n\\n4. Smartism\\n\\nSmartism is a liberal or nonsectarian denomination of the Vedic Hindu religion which accepts all \\nthe major\\nHindu deities as forms of the one Brahman.\\n\\nThe term Smarta refers to adherents who follow the Vedas and Shastras. Only a section of south \\nIndian\\nbrahmins call themselves Smartas now.\\n\\nSmartas are followers and propagators of Smriti or religious texts derived from Vedic scriptures.\\nSmarta\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nreligion was practiced by people who believed in the authority of the Vedas as well as the basic \\npremise of\\n\\npuranas. As a consequence usually only a brahmin preferred to use this term to refer to his family \\ntradition.\\n\\nIt is most essential for Smarta Brahmins to specialize in the Karma Kanda of the Vedas and \\nassociated\\nrituals diligently, and to teach the subsequent generations.\\n\\nVarnas\\n\\nHindu society has been categorized into four classes, called varnas. They are:\\n\\n(i) the Brahmins: Vedic teachers and priests;\\n\\n(ii) the Kshatriyas: warriors, nobles, and kings;\\n\\n(iii) the Vaishyas: farmers, merchants, and businessmen; and\\n\\n(iv) the Shudras: servants and labourers\\n\\nBhagavad Gita, the sacred text of Hindus, links the varna to an individual\\'s duty (svadharma), \\ninborn nature\\n\\n(svabhâva), and natural tendencies (gupa).\\n\\nAshramas\\n\\nTraditionally the life of a Hindu is divided into four Ashramas (phases or stages).\\n\\nThe first part of one\\'s life, Wa/z ec zzg, the stage as a student, is spent in celibate, \\ncontrolled, sober\\nand pure contemplation under the guidance of a Guru, building up the mind for spiritual knowledge.\\n\\n&? as//zz is the householder\\'s stage, in which one marries and satisfies kâma and artha in one\\'s \\nmarried\\nand professional life respectively.\\n\\nYanaprastha, the retirement stage, is gradual detachment from the material world. This may involve \\ngiving\\nover duties to one\\'s children, spending more time in religious practices and embarking on holy \\npilgrimages.\\n\\nFinally, in Sannyasa, the stage of asceticism, one renounces all worldly attachments to secludedly \\nfind the\\nDivine through detachment from worldly life and peacefully shed the body for Moksha.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nHindu texts\\n\\nHindu literature can be divided into two categories: Shruti - that which is revealed and\\nSmriti - that which is remembered.\\n\\nThe Vedas coming under the Shruti category are considered sacred scripture. Later texts like the \\nvarious shastras\\n\\nand the itihaasas form Smruti. Holding an ambiguous position between the Upanishads of the Vedas \\nand the epics,\\n\\nthe Bhagavad Gita is considered to be revered scripture by most Hindus today. All Shruti scriptures \\nare composed\\nin Sanskrit.\\n\\nHindu Pilgrimage\\n\\nImportant Pilgrimage sites of Hindu devotees are:\\n\\n/ «z  dé/a One of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every 12 years; the location is \\nrotated\\namong Allahabad, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. It is considered as one of the largest pilgrimage \\ngathering\\n\\nin the world.\\n\\nz7zzr ZZezzr(Famous Four Pilgrimage sites): The four holy sites Puri, Rameswaram, Dwarka, and \\nBadrinath compose the Char Dham (four abodes) pilgrimage circuit.\\nOd/-flay crimes as per Puranic Texts: Varanasi formerly known as Kashi, Allahabad formerly known as\\nPrayag, Haridwar-Rishikesh, Mathura-Vrindavan, Pandharpur, Paithan and Ayodhya.\\n\\n“m Tezjs¥\\'e crores: Puri, which hosts a major Vaishnava Jagannath temple and Rath Yatra \\ncelebration;\\nKatra, home to the Vaishno Devi temple; Three comparatively recent temples of fame and huge \\npilgrimage\\n\\nare Shirdi, home to Sai Baba of Shirdi, Tirumala - Tirupati, home to the Tirumala Venkateswara \\nTemple;\\n\\nand Sabarimala, where Swami Ayyappan is worshipped.\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nEli:I? 73ner  Another important set of pilgrimages are the Shakti Peethas, where the Mother Goddess\\nis worshipped, the two principal ones being Kalighat and Kamakhya.\\n\\n2. Shramana Traditions\\n\\nThe Shramana movement was a Non-Vedic movement parallel to Vedic Hinduism in ancient India.\\nThe Shramana\\n\\ntradition gave rise to Jainism, Buddhism, and Yoga, and was responsible for the related concepts of \\nsamsâra (the\\n\\ncycle of birth and death) and moksha (liberation from that cycle).\\n\\nSramanism, emphasizing thought, hard work and discipline, was one of the three strands of Hindu \\nphilosophy. The\\n\\nother two included Brahmanism, which drew its philosophical essence from Mimamsa. The third and \\nmost popular\\n\\nstrand of Indian philosophical thought revolves around the concept of Bhakti or Theism, based on \\nthe\\nidea of God,\\n\\nas understood in most parts of the world.\\n\\nPhilosophy\\n\\nSramapas held a view of samsara as full of suffering (Dukka). They practiced Ahimsa and rigorous \\nascetism. They\\n\\nbelieved in Karma and Moksa and viewed rebirth as undesirable. Vedics, on the contrary believe in \\nthe efficacy of\\n\\nrituals and sacrifices, performed by a privileged group of people, who could improve their life by \\npleasing certain\\n\\nGods. Beliefs and concepts of Sramana philosophies: Denial of creator and omnipotent Gods\\nRejection of the Vedas as revealed texts\\n\\nAffirmation of Karma and rebirth, Samsara and transmigration of Soul.\\n\\nAffirmation of the attainment of moksa through Ahimsa, renunciation and austerities Denial of the \\nefficacy of sacrifices and rituals for purification.\\nRejection of the caste system\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nJainism and Buddhism are the two main schools philosophies that have continued in India since \\nancient times.\\n3. Jainism\\n\\nThe distinguishing features of Jain philosophy are its belief on independent existence of soul and \\nmatter, absence\\n\\nof a supreme divine creator, potency of karma, eternal and uncreated universe, a strong emphasis on \\nnon-violence,\\n\\nmorality and ethics based on liberation of soul.\\n\\nJainism is the sixth largest religion in India and is followed throughout the India. Lakshadweep is \\nthe only Union\\n\\nTerritory/state without Jains. Maharashtra has the highest number of Jain Population. Like most \\nancient Indian\\n\\nreligions, Jainism has its roots from the Indus Valley Civilization, reflecting native spirituality \\nprior to the Indo-Aryan\\n\\nmigration into India.\\n\\nPrinciples of Jainism\\n\\nJainism encourages spiritual development through cultivation of one\\'s own personal wisdom and \\nreliance on selfcontrol\\n\\nthrough vows. Ascetics of this religion undertake five major vows:\\n\\n1. Ahimsa (Non-violence): The first major vow taken by ascetics is to cause no harm to living \\nbeings.\\n\\nIt involves minimizing intentional as well as unintentional harm to other living creatures.\\n\\n2. Satya (Truth): The vow is to always speak of truth. Given that non-violence has priority, other \\nprinciples yield to it whenever there is a conflict. In a situation where speaking truth could lead \\nto violence, silence is to be observed.\\n3. Asteya: Asteya, is to not take into possession, anything that is not willingly offered. Attempt \\nto squeeze material wealth from others or exploit the weak is considered theft.\\n4. Brahmacharya: The vow of brahmacharya requires one to exercise control over senses from \\nindulgence in sexual activity.\\n5. Aparigraha: Aparigraha is to observe detachment from people, places and material things.\\n\\nAscetics live a life of complete renunciation of property and human relations.\\n\\nJain metaphysics is based on seven or nine fundamentals which are known as Call va. These are an \\nattempt to\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nexplain the nature and solution to the human predicament. These are:\\n\\nJ\\'rxa: The living entities are called Jiva. It is a substance which is different from the body that \\nhouses it.\\nConsciousness, knowledge and perception are the fundamental attributes of the Jiva.\\n\\n/)T va: The non-living entities which consists of matter, space and time falls into the category of \\nAjiva.\\n\\nAxe a Due to the interaction between the two substances, jTva and ajTva, there is influx of a\\nspecial ajiva\\n\\ncalled karma into the soul. This karma then sticks to the soul.\\n\\nZB  The karma masks the jiva and restricts it from having its true potential of perfect knowledge\\nand\\n\\nperception.\\n\\nfiaa. za Through right conduct, it is possible to stop the influx of additional karma.\\n\\nIlirJarâ: By performing asceticism, it is possible to shred or burn up the existing karma.\\n\\nIsle\\' The jiva which has removed its karma is said to be liberated and have its pure, intrinsic \\nquality of\\nperfect knowledge in its true form.\\n\\nAuthors sometimes add two additional categories: the meritorious and demeritorious acts related to\\nkarma. These\\n\\nare called /zct a and papa respectively.\\n\\nTirtankara\\n\\nJainism has been preached by a succession of twenty-four propagators of faith known as 77z/ ezKaza. \\nTirtankara\\n\\nis a human being who helps in achieving liberation and enlightenment as an \"Arihant\" by destroying \\nall of their soul\\n\\nconstraining (ghati) karmas, became a role-model and leader for those seeking spiritual guidance. \\nThere are 24\\n\\nTirthañkaras and each of them revitalized the Jain Order.\\n\\nTirthankara is also said to mean “full moon,” a metaphorical reference to Kevala Jnana. Keval Gnan \\nis\\na state of\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\npermanent, perpetual, absolute knowledge of the Soul; it is the precursor to moksha, final \\nliberation from samsara,\\n\\nthe cycle of birth and death.\\n\\nJaina tradition identifies Rishabha (Adinath) as the first tirthankara. The last two tirthankara, \\nParshva and Mahavira\\nare historical figures whose existence is recorded.\\n\\nA z2¥z4zazz</? is an emperor of the world and lord of the material realm. Though he possesses \\nworldly power, he\\n\\noften finds his ambitions dwarfed by the enormity of the cosmos. Jaina puruna give a list of twelve \\nChakravarti. One\\n\\nof the greatest Chakravarti mentioned in Jaina scriptures is Bharata. Tradition says that India \\ncame to be known as\\n\\nBharata-varsha in the memory of this Bharata.\\n\\nThere are nine sets of baladeva, v6sudeva and prati v6sudeva. Baladeva are non-violent heroes.\\nVasudeva are\\n\\nviolent heroes and prativâsudeva can be termed as villains. Vasudeva ultimately kills \\nprativasudeva.\\nBaladeva\\n\\ngoes to heaven. On the other hand, vasudeva go to hell on account of their violent exploits, even \\nif they were to\\n\\nuphold righteousness.\\n\\nJain sects\\n\\nIn the 4th century CE, Jainism developed two major divisions ZZj; zxzfa<a (sky clad ascetics) and\\n\\n\\n(white robed ascetics). Both Digambara and Svetambara communities have continued to develop, almost\\n\\nindependently of each other. With the passage of time, both had further sub-sects. Except for some \\nminor\\n\\ndifferences in rituals and way of life, their belief and practices for the spiritual progress are \\nthe same.\\nThe four main\\n\\nsects with a sizable population are Digambara, Svetambara Murtipujaka, Sthanakavasi and Terapanthi.\\n\\nThe Digambaras, like Mahavira, practice total nudity to avoid all attachments. The Shvetambaras \\nreject nudity as\\n\\nan exterior symbol having no significance on their inner spiritual development. They also accepted \\nwomen into the\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nmonastic community early on, unlike the Digambaras.\\n\\nJaina Literature\\n\\nThe fourteen Purvas was a body of Jain scriptures preached by tirthankara of Jainism. These \\nteachings were\\n\\nmemorized and passed on through ages, but became fairly vulnerable and died off within one thousand \\nyears after\\n\\nLord Mahavira\\'s nirvana (liberation).\\n\\nAgamas are canonical texts of Jainism based on Mahavira\\'s teachings. Mahavira\\'s preachings were \\norally\\n\\ncompiled by his disciples into various Sutras (texts) which were collectively called Jain canonical \\nor Agamic\\n\\nliterature. These Agamas are composed of forty-six texts: twelve angâs, twelve upanga âgamas, six \\nchedasutras,\\n\\nfour mulasutras, ten prakTrnaka sutras and two culikasutras.\\n\\nSvetambaras accept thirty-two to forty-five aagamas, final redaction of which took place at the \\nCouncil of Valabhi\\n\\n(453 - 466 BCE). Digambaras accept two canonical texts Satkhandaagama and Kasaayapahuda composed in \\n2nd\\n\\ncentury CE.\\n\\nJains had a major influence in developing a system of philosophy and ethics that had a great impact \\non Indian\\n\\nculture. They have contributed to the culture and language of the Indian states Tamil Nadu, \\nKarnataka, Gujarat and\\n\\nRajasthan. Jain Rituals\\nSolar izz\\'<a is the fundamental prayer of Jainism. In this prayer there is no mention of names, \\nincluding\\nthat of thetirthankara. It does not ask for favors or material benefits, it simply serves as a \\ngesture of deep\\n\\nrespect towards beings they believe are more spiritually advanced and to remind followers of the \\nJainism of\\n\\ntheir ultimate goal of nirvana.\\n\\nJains follow six obligatory duties known as has  atas includes samyika (pracitising serenity),\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nchaturvimshati (praising tirthankara), vandan (respecting teachers and monks), Pratikramana, \\nKayotsarga,\\n\\npratyakhyana (renunciation).\\n\\n73zx zzs/zaza is one of the most important festivals for the Jains. Normally Svetambara Jains refer \\nit\\nas\\n\\nParyushana, while Digambara Jains refer it as Das Lakshana. It is believed that the deva do \\nashtprakari\\n\\npuja of tirthankara and it takes them eight days to do this ashtaprakari puja. This is called \\nAshtanhika Mahotsav, so at the very same time Jains celebrate it as Paryushan. Paryushana lasts \\neight days for Svetambara Jains and ten days for Digambaras Jains.\\nMahavira Jayanti, the birthday of Mahavira, is celebrated on the thirteenth day of the fortnight of \\nthe waxing\\nmoon, in the month of Chaitra.\\n\\nA unique ritual in this religion involves a holy fasting until death called &//zsUzazzz Through \\nthis one\\nachieves a death with dignity and dispassion as well as a reduction of negative karma to a great \\nextent.\\n\\nThis form of dying is also called Gz \\'/zara.\\n\\n4. Buddhism\\n\\nBuddhism is a religion indigenous to the Indian subcontinent that encompasses a variety of \\ntraditions, beliefs and\\n\\npractices largely based on teachings attributed to Siddhartha Gautama, who is commonly known as the \\nBuddha.\\n\\nBuddha is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to \\nhelp\\n\\nsentient beings end suffering (dukkha) through eliminating ignorance (avidyâ) by way of \\nunderstanding and seeing\\n\\ndependent origination (pratTtyasamutpâda) and eliminating craving (taphâ), and thus attain the \\nhighest happiness,\\n\\nnirvâna.\\n\\nBuddhism reached its peak under the Mauryan Empire (322-185 AD). Ashoka gave royal patronage to \\nBuddhism\\n\\nand made it a pan-Asian religion. He sponsored Buddhist missions to various areas within his empire \\nand also to\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nthe Greek-ruled areas of the Northwest, Sri Lanka in the south as well as the Central Asia. After \\nthe death of\\n\\nAshoka, Buddhism did not get a direct royal patronage. Soon Buddhism declined and was almost wiped \\nout from\\n\\nIndia but instead spread to the South East Asian countries and to Sri Lanka. Gautama Buddha\\nSiddhârtha Gautama was born in Lumbini in modern-day Nepal, around the year 563 BCE, and raised in\\n\\nKapilavastu. Young prince Gautama was kept away from seeing the sufferings of normal people since \\nan\\n\\nastrologer prophesied that he would renounce the material world if sees the miseries of Life. In a \\nseries of\\n\\nencounters, known in Buddhist literature as the h<  srj;dds, he learned of the suffering of \\nordinary people,\\n\\nencountering an old man, a sick man, a corpse and, finally, an ascetic holy man, apparently content \\nand at peace\\n\\nwith the world. These experiences prompted Gautama to abandon royal life and take up a spiritual \\nquest.\\n\\nFor six years, Siddhartha submitted himself to rigorous ascetic practices, studying and following \\ndifferent methods\\n\\nof meditation with various religious teachers. But he was never fully satisfied. One day, however, \\nhe was offered a\\n\\nbowl of rice from a young girl and he accepted it. In that moment, he realised that physical \\nausterities were not the\\n\\nmeans to achieve liberation. From then on, he encouraged people to follow a path of balance rather \\nthan\\n\\nextremism. He called this Zoe fof:d\\'e /y\\'\\n\\nAt the age of 35, Siddhartha sat under the Bodhi tree, in the town of Bodh Gaya in India, and \\nmeditated. He purified\\n\\nhis mind of all defilements and attained enlightenment after many days, thus earning the title \\nBuddha,\\nor\\n\\n\"Enlightened One\".\\n\\nThereafter, he attracted a band of followers and instituted a monastic order. He spent the rest of \\nhis life teaching\\n\\nthe path of awakening he had discovered, traveling throughout the north-eastern part of the Indian \\nsubcontinent,\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nand died at the age of 80 (483 BCE) in Kushinagar, India.\\n\\nPrinciples\\n\\n&zzzaza is \"the cycle of birth and death\". Sentient beings crave pleasure and are averse to pain \\nfrom birth to\\ndeath. Buddhists strive to end the sufferings by eradicating the causes and conditions, applying \\nthe methods laid\\n\\nout by the Buddha and subsequent Buddhists.\\n\\n/ zrm in Buddhism is the force that drives samsâra. Good, skillful deeds (kusala) and bad, \\nunskillful (akusala)\\n\\nactions produce \"seeds\" in the mind that come to fruition either in this life or in a subsequent \\nrebirth.\\nThe avoidance\\n\\nof unwholesome actions and the cultivation of positive actions is called 5r/a.\\n\\n7Z\\'Zrx/ r refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many \\npossible forms of\\nsentient life, each running from conception to death. Buddhism rejects the concepts of a permanent \\nself or an\\n\\nunchanging, eternal soul, as it is called in Hinduism and Christianity. Each rebirth takes place \\nwithin\\none of five\\n\\nrealms according to Theravadins, or six according to other schools. These are further subdivided \\ninto 31 planes of\\n\\nexistence.\\n\\n\\nBranches of Buddhism\\n\\nTwo branches of Buddhism are generally recognized: Mahayana (\"The Great Vehicle\") and Theravada \\n(\"The\\nSchool of the Elders\")\\n\\n7IU\\'7 z az¥z The followers of Mahayana believe that Buddha taught universal salvation. One should \\nnot aim\\nat personal nirvana and should help ease the suffering of humanity. Mahayana Buddhism is found\\n\\nthroughout East Asia (China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan etc.) and includes the \\ntraditions of\\n\\nPure Land, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism, Shingon, and Tiantai (Tendai). In India, this \\nform\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nof Buddhism is followed in Ladakh, Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh.\\n\\n7Zeraczdz The Theravada Buddhism is better known as the earliest form of Buddhism. The ‘Thera’\\nmeans\\n\\nold and ‘Vada’ means school. The aim of this form of Buddhism is to attain personal nirvana through \\nthe\\n\\ntriple recourse to ethical conduct, mental discipline and higher knowledge or wisdom. It has a \\nwidespread\\n\\nfollowing in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar etc.). In India, this \\nstrain of\\n\\nBuddhism is represented by the followers of Dr B.R.Ambedkar known as the Ambedkar Buddhists, who \\nare\\n\\nexclusive to India.\\n\\nIn some classifications, +y^ x•zza practiced mainly in Tibet and Mongolia, and adjacent parts of \\nChina and Russia\\n\\nis recognized as a third branch. 7 \\'ze za is an ugly Mahayana polemical term coined by Mahayanists \\nto both\\nclassify and refer to those schools of Buddhism with which the Mahayana disagreed.\\n\\nThe Four Noble Truths\\n\\nThe teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism. These \\nfour truths\\n\\nexplain the nature of dukkha, its causes, and how it can be overcome. They can be summarized as \\nfollows:\\n\\n1. The truth of dukkha (suffering, anxiety, dissatisfaction): explains the nature of dukkha.\\n\\n2. The truth of the origin of dukkha: It says that the origin of dukkha can be known. The origin of \\ndukkha is\\n\\ncommonly explained as craving conditioned by ignorance. On a deeper level, the root cause of dukkha \\nis\\n\\nidentified as ignorance.\\n\\n3. The truth of the cessation of dukkha: It says that the complete cessation of dukkha is possible.\\n\\n4. The truth of the path leading to the cessation of dukkha: It identifies a path to cessation of \\ndukkha.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nNoble Eightfold Path\\n\\nThe Noble Eightfold Path consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions, that when \\ndeveloped\\n\\ntogether, lead to the cessation of dukkha. The Eight factors are:\\n\\n1. 77j;dd her/m 7Zj;dz* Mo6\\'<sz’az¥ \\'zgj/. Viewing reality as it is, not just as it appears to be\\n\\n? 77j;d \\' /z \\'e/z’?o7 {m 77j;dd 7Zaacgddg.

Taking \"refuge in the triple gem\" has traditionally been a \\ndeclaration and\\ncommitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-\\nBuddhist. Other\\n\\npractices may include following ethical precepts; support of the monastic community; renouncing \\nconventional\\n\\nliving and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; \\ncultivation of higher\\n\\nwisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana \\ntradition,\\n\\ninvocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.\\n\\nThe Buddhist place of worship is called a If7¥z<a or bgzzz, which usually houses one or more \\nstatues of the\\nBuddha. The five great events in Buddha\\'s life are represented by symbols as under:\\n\\n(i) Birth by Zz¥\\'zxs azz7\\'ZS\\'//\\n\\n(ii) Great Renunciation by Use\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n(iii) Nirvana by   free\\n\\n(iv) First Sermon by ZZ¥zxwc/zz4xa or Wheel\\n\\n(v) Parinirvana or death by the &zz,oz.\\n\\nDharmachakra\\n\\nThe Wheel of Law or dharmachakra, is the most important symbol of Buddhism. According to the \\nBuddha, dharma\\n\\nis the law that ensures the welfare of the greatest number of people if practiced faithfully. The \\nwheel symbolises the\\n\\ngoodness in every person. The wheel has eight spokes representing the eight virtues enumerated by \\nthe Eight Fold\\n\\nPath, the path to salvation.\\n\\nTibetan Buddhism\\n\\nThe Tibetan Buddhism is \"essentially Buddhism of the Mahayana school, with elements of modified \\nShaivism and\\n\\nnative ritualistic shamanism\". Monks belonging to this strain of Buddhism are called laws. Tibetan \\nBuddhism, also\\n\\ncalled Zazsrsm is a predominant religion of Tibet, Mongolia and other parts of the world. In India \\nit is practised by\\n\\nover 1,20,000 Tibetans settled in their different settlements at Dharamsala, Dehradun (UP),\\nKushalnagar\\n\\n(Karnataka), Darjeeling (West BengaI),ArunachaI Pradesh, Sikkim and Ladakh.\\n\\nThe Tibetan Buddhism follows a strict code of traditional hierarchy. The supreme position is \\noccupied by two lamas:\\n\\nthe Z2z/ar Zam (Grand Lama) and the /bxxzWzz Zazzs (Bogodo Lama). Of the two, the Dalai Lama is\\nmore\\n\\npowerful and is considered as the spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism, while the Panchen Lama is the \\nsecond most\\n\\nsenior religious authority. Next in rank are the Hutukhtus, or spiritual dignitaries. The Rimpoches \\nor Hobilghans or\\n\\nbodhisattvas form the third level of authority.\\n\\nThe present and the 14tx Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was identified and enthroned in 1940, in Lhasa. \\nAfter the\\n\\nChinese annexation of Tibet in 1950, the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 and established a \\nGovernment-in-exile at\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nDharamshala in Himachal Pradesh.\\n\\n5. Sikhism\\n\\nSikhism began about 500 years ago by Guru Nanak and preaches a message of devotion and remembrance \\nto\\n\\nGod at all times, truthful living and equality of mankind and denounces superstitions and blind \\nrituals.\\nSikhism is\\n\\nopen to all through the teachings of its 10 Gurus enshrined in the Sikh Holy Book,  Cazz\"/z zzr &/\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinciples of Sikhism\\n\\nSikhs believe that God is Monistic or Non-dual. He is the creator of the Universe, whose existence \\nand continued\\n\\nsurvival depends on His will. God is both Saguna (with attributes) and Nirguna (without attributes) \\nand is called by\\n\\nnames such as Sat (truth), Sat Guru (true Guru), Akal Purkh (timeless being), Kadar(creator) and\\nWahi-Guru\\n\\n(praise to the God).\\n\\nThe belief in the ten Gurus - spiritual guides who dispel ignorance and darkness is the essential \\nelement of Sikh\\n\\nreligion. According to it the only way to achieve liberation (mukti) from the cycle of birth and \\ndeath is by being Godconscious\\n\\n(gurmukh).\\n\\nThe Khalsa and five K\\'s\\n\\nThe concept of Khalsa, literally meaning ‘the pure\\', was introduced by Guru Gobind Singh. He \\nestablished this new\\n\\nfraternity with five followers (later known as Panj Pyares), who were baptized with amrit as \\nKhalsas.\\nThe Khalsa\\n\\nsymbolised coalescence of serenity and strength, purity and power, shastra (scripture) and shastra \\n(weapon), and\\n\\nthe power of wisdom (jnana shakti) and the power of action (kriya shakti).\\n\\nIt was made obligatory for every Sikh to wear the Five K\\'s - Kesha (long hair), Kangha (comb), Kara \\n(steel\\n\\nbracelet), Kaccha (short drawers) and Kirpan (sword). Sri Guru Granth Sahib\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Guru Granth Sahib (also known as the Adi Granth) is considered the Supreme Spiritual Authority \\nand Head of\\n\\nthe Sikh religion. It is a collection of devotional hymns and poetry which proclaims God, lays \\nstress on meditation\\n\\non the True Guru (God) and lays down moral and ethical rules for development of the soul, spiritual \\nsalvation and\\n\\nunity with God.\\n\\nThe writings of the Gurus appear chronologically. Each of the Gurus signed their hymns as 7Bzed\\nGuru Granth\\n\\nSahib has 3,384 hymns, of which Guru Nanak Dev contributed 974 hymns including sloks and pauris.\\nIt also\\n\\ncontains Bhagatas of Kabir, Namdev, Ravidas, Sheikh Farid, Trilochan, Dhanna, Beni, Sheikh Bhikan, \\nJaidev,\\n\\nSurdas, Parmanand, Pipa and Ramanand. The fifth Guru Arjan Dev began the great task of collection\\nof the holy\\n\\ncompositions as Sri (Amritsar) and compiled the Holy Granth Sahib.\\n\\n6. Islam\\n\\nThe religion of Islam teaches that in order to achieve true peace of mind and surety of heart, one \\nmust submit to\\n\\nGod and live according to His Divinely revealed Law. The word ’Muslim\\' means one who submits to the \\nwill of God,\\n\\nregardless of their race, nationality or ethnic background.\\n\\nMuslims believe that all of God\\'s prophets which include Abraham, Noah, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, \\nbrought\\n\\nthe same message of Pure Monotheism. For this reason, Prophet Muhammad is not considered as the \\nfounder of a\\n\\nnew religion, as many people mistakenly think, but he was the Final Prophet of Islam.\\n\\nPrinciples of Islam\\n\\nAccording to traditional Islamic belief, the religion has existed since time immemorial. Allah, the \\nAImighty God,\\n\\ncreated Adam (the father of the human progeny) out of a lump of clay and commanded the angels to \\ngreet him with\\n\\na ’Sijda’ (prostration in humility). All the angels obeyed the command with the exception of Iblis \\n(the Satan). This\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nresulted in Satan\\'s condemnation and Allah commanded that whosoever followed the Satan\\'s path will \\nforfeit His\\n\\npleasure and that his abode will be in the fire of hell eternally. Basic Islamic Beliefs are:\\n(i) had  This means, believe in One, Unique, Incomparable God Who is the Creator, the Ruler and the \\nSustainer of the universe, and none has the right to be worshipped but He alone\\n(ii) Belief in the existence of Angels of God as the honoured creatures\\n\\n(iii) Belief in God\\'s Revealed Books\\n\\n(iv) Belief in the Prophets and Messengers of God\\n\\n(v) Belief in the Day of Judgement and Life after Death\\n\\n(vi) Belief in Predestination - God\\'s complete authority over human destiny Main sects of Islam\\nThe followers of Muslim are divided into two main sects: had  azzz’   . Though essentially \\nfollowing the same\\nbeliefs and tenets, they differ on two points: the succession to Prophet Muhammad, and the \\nreligious authority in\\n\\nIslam after him.\\n\\nPhszzzis a minority branch of Islam which makes up about one tenth of the total population of the \\nMuslim world.\\nThe Shiites form an important part of the population in a number of Arab countries like Iraq, \\nBahrain, Lebanon and\\n\\nIran. The Shiahs consider Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet as his rightful heir. They maintain \\nthat Ali was the first\\n\\nlegitimate Imam or Khalifah (Caliph) and therefore reject Abu Bakr, Omar and Usman, the first three \\nKhalifahs of\\n\\nthe Sunni Muslims, as usurpers. There are two main shiite sects:\\n(i) The ”7\"ue/ ners” are by far the largest group of Shiah Islam. They believe that the line of Ali \\nbecame extinct with aI-Askari, the Twelfth Imam, who mysteriously disappeared in 873 AD. They \\nhowever refuse to accept that aI-Askari died and believe that he will appear shortly before the end \\nof the world.\\n(ii) The /st/ries  &ve s are the second largest shiite sect. Their spiritual leader is the Aga\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nKhan. The Ismailites only recognize the seven first Imams.\\n\\nChszzzis the main branch of Islam and recognizes the legitimacy of the first four Khalifahs or \\nCaliphs. The\\nSunnis believe that the office of the Prophet was not hereditary and no one could claim to be his \\nsole heir. The\\n\\ncommunity chooses one amongst themselves as their leader or the Khalifah.\\n\\nThere are four orthodox sects among the Sunni Muslims i.e. 7dzze/has (followers of Imam Abu \\nHanifah),  /r a/z\\n\\n(followers of Imam Ash-Shafii), id/air A (followers of Imam Malik) and /d\\'xdzz/?ja/z (followers of \\nImam Ahmed\\nBin Hanbal).\\n\\nKhalifah\\n\\nThe word Caliph or Khalifah, means ’successor\\' or \\'deputy’. It is used to designate the Prophet\\'s \\nsuccessor as\\n\\nleader of the Muslim community. This title was used by the successive Arab empires and by the \\nOttoman sultans.\\n\\nThe Ottoman Caliphate was maintained for two years after the abolition of the Sultanate, until it \\nwas itself abolished\\n\\nby Kemal Ataturk in February 1924.\\n\\nProphets of Islam\\n\\nAccording to Islamic belief, Allah has sent various Prophets to the world at different times and \\ndifferent places to\\n\\nguide the people on the righteous path.\\n\\nThe names of the following Prophets are mentioned in the Holy Quran: Adam, Sheth, Idris, Nuh \\n(Noah), Hud, Salih,\\nLut, Ibrahim (Abraham), Ismail, Ishaq (Isaac), Yaqub (Jacob), Yusuf (Joseph), Shuaib, Dawud \\n(David), Sulaiman\\n\\n(Solomon), Ilyas, Al-Yasa (Elisha), Musa (Moses), Aziz (Ubair or Ezra), Ayyub (Job), Dhul-Kifl \\n(Isaih or Kharqil Bin\\n\\nThauri), Yunus (Jonah), Zakariya (Zachariah), Yahya (John the Baptist), Isa (Jesus Christ) and \\nMuhammad.\\n\\nProphet Muhammad\\n\\nProphet Muhammad is considered as the messenger of Allah and the last of all Prophets who restored \\nIslam to its\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\npristine purity. Prophet Muhammad was born in 570 AD at tha7z At the age of 40, Prophet Muhammad \\nreceived\\n\\nhis first revelation from Allah through the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel) in a cave at Mount Hira near \\nMakkah.\\nThe\\n\\nrevelations continued for 23 years, and they are collectively known as the zgzz .\\n\\nHe began preaching these revelations to the common populace in Makkah. Due to sever opposition from \\nthe\\n\\nunbelievers, Prophet Muhammad and his followers undertook the great migration or V/ra to a town \\ncalled Yathrib,\\nwhich later came to be known as Medina. This emigration marks the beginning of the Muslim Calendar.\\n\\nIn Medina, Islam began to flourish and Prophet Muhammad died at the age of 63. As a mark of respect \\nto the\\n\\nProphet, the Muslims use the words \\'Peace Be Upon Him’ after his name. Islam in India\\nIslam first came to India at the Malabar Coast of Kerala through Arab traders as early as 6 AD.\\nSeveral centuries\\n\\nlater the local population that embraced Islam became a well-knit social and cultural group known \\nas the was.\\n\\nWithin the next 200 years, the first Muslim empire, the Delhi Sultanate, was established in India \\nwith its capital in\\n\\nDelhi. This was followed by several other Muslim dynasties like the Khiljis, the Tughlaqs, the \\nLodis and the\\n\\nMughals. The period of the Mughals was the golden age of Islam in India. The religion flourished \\nunder the Mughal\\n\\nrule and many Indians embraced Islam. Today Muslims constitute about 12% of India\\'s population\\nand are\\n\\nconcentrated largely in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and \\nKashmir.\\n\\n7. Sufism\\n\\nSufism or /asaio«d°, as it is called in Arabic, is generally understood by scholars and Sufis to be \\nthe inner,\\n\\nmystical, or psycho-spiritual dimension of Islam. Today, however, many Muslims and non-Muslims \\nbelieve that\\n\\nSufism is outside the sphere of Islam.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Origin\\n\\nThe origins of Sufism can be traced to the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad, whose teachings \\nattracted a group of\\n\\nscholars who came to be called be   ie”, the People of Suffe, from their practice of sitting at the\\nplatform of\\n\\nthe mosque of the Prophet in Medina. There they engaged themselves in discussions concerning the\\nreality of\\n\\n‘Being’, and in search of the inner path and devoted themselves to spiritual purification and \\nmeditation. These\\n\\nindividuals were the founders of Sufism.\\n\\nFundamental principles\\n\\nSufis represented the inner side of the Islamic creed, which stresses on self-realisation, \\nbeautification\\nof the soul\\n\\nthrough piety, righteousness and universal love for all. The Sufis consider that there is a \\nparticular Divine Attribute\\n\\nthat dominates the being of every prophet and saint, such that they can be said to be the \\nincarnation of that\\n\\nattribute. The aim of Sufism is the cultivation of Perfect Beings who are mirrors reflecting the \\nDivine Names and\\n\\nAttributes.\\n\\nIn Sufism, a perfect being is also called a W/? (saint), a word that literally means \\'sincere \\nfriend\\'. The superstructure of Sufism is built upon the concept of teacher, @z or zm\\'rsTé’\\nSufism had succeeded in inculcating the sentiments of fraternity, equality and equity, coupled with \\nsense of service\\nto humanity, in the followers, irrespective of race, community, caste, creed and colour.\\n\\nIn India, Sufism helped in maintaining communal harmony and social stability by advocating \\nreligious tolerance\\n\\nand by borrowing spiritual techniques and practices from other religions. Sufism has adapted \\nextensively from\\n\\nthe Vedanta school of the Hindu philosophy.\\n\\nSama\\n\\nThe musical and ecstatic aspect of Sufism is called Sama. This is a particular kind of devotional \\ndance akin to Kirtana and was introduced by Jalaluddin Rumi. The Sufi, while\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nbeing spiritually enraptured, gives the attention of his or her heart to the Beloved. With \\nparticular movements and often special and rhythmical music, he engages in the selfless remembrance \\nof God.\\nSufis identify two types of Sama poetry:\\n\\n1. First praising God (this is called Hamd), Prophet (this is called Naat) and the Sufi saints \\n(this is called WmZe \\'.g\\n2. The second focussing on spiritual emotion or mystical love, ecstatic states and on separation \\nand union.\\n\\nThe Sama poetry is mostly sung in the form of Qawwali. Music of Sama is set within metric \\nframework,\\n\\naccompanied by Dholak, Tabla, Sarangi, Harmonium and Sitar.\\n\\n8. Muslim Religious Movements\\n\\nDawoodi Bohras\\n\\nThe word \\'Bohra\\' is derived from the Gujarati word vohorvu or vyavahar meaning \"to trade\". The \\nMuslim community\\n\\nof Daudi Bohras traces its ancestry to early conversions to Ismaili Shiism during the reign of the \\nFatimid Caliph\\n\\nImam, aI-Mustansir (1036-1094 AD). When schisms occurred in the Ismaili dawah (mission) in the \\neleventh and\\n\\ntwelfth centuries in Egypt, the Ismailis in India followed the Fatimid Tayyibi dawah of Yemen.\\nSubsequently, this\\n\\ncommunity split a number of times to form the Jafari Bohras, Daudi Bohras, Sulaymani Bohras, Aliyah \\nBohras and\\nother lesser-known groups.\\n\\nThe religious hierarchy of the Daudi Bohras is essentially Fatimid and is headed by the  zm\\'/ap’ \\nwho is\\n\\nappointed by his predecessor in office. The dai appoints two others to the subsidiary ranks of zzaz \\n¥ y (licentiate)\\n\\nand zm\\'4as?z (executor). These positions are followed by the rank of shall and zs’/laid, both of \\nwhich are held by\\n\\nhundreds of Bohras. An Ax¥/ leads the local congregation in religious, social and communal affairs.\\nEach town\\n\\nhas a mosque and an adjoining jamaat-khanah (assembly hall) where socio-religious functions are \\nheld.\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Bohras recognize the seven pillars of Islam. Walayah (love and devotion) for Allah, the \\nProphets, the imam\\n\\nand the dai is the first and most important of the seven pillars. The others are tahrah (purity & \\ncleanliness), salat\\n\\n(prayers), zakat (purifying religious dues), saum (fasting), haj (pilgrimage to Mecca) and jihad \\n(holy war).\\n\\nThe Bohras enjoy a great degree of social and religious cohesion. Every Bohra is required to take \\nan oath of\\n\\nallegiance (J/\\'saag}, which is a formal initiation into the faith. The oath, inter alia, commits a \\nBohra towards\\nadherence to the Shariah and accepting the leadership of the Sayyidna and the dai.\\n\\nThe cult of & ?z¥zz, the high priest, and the 7 \\' ez, the clergy, is deeply ingrained in the Bohra \\npsyche. Every\\nBohra follows a system of tax payment to the Syedna, who also exercises a great control over the \\nmarriage and\\n\\ndeath rites. Another distinctive feature is their use of a /g\\'/rx¥o’/zzzzar ca/ezx \\'x which fixes \\nthe number of days in\\neach month.\\n\\nWahabism\\n\\nWahabism was the first great modern expression of the awakening of the Arab Islam in the 18th \\ncentury. Its\\n\\nfounder was Muhammad Ibn Abd-aI-Wahab. He preached and propagated the \"pure faith\" based only\\non the Holy\\n\\nQuran and the Sunnah and criticised the loosening of moral standards under foreign influences. \\nWahabism led in\\n\\n1932 to the creation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The only other Wahabi state is Qatar.\\n\\nThe Wahabis do not receive the decisions of the four orthodox sects, but say that any man who can \\nread and\\n\\nunderstand the Quran and the Ahadith can judge for himself in the matters of doctrine. They do not \\noffer prayers to\\n\\nany prophet, wali, pir or saint. They do not even perform any act of reverence at the Prophet\\'s \\nmosque at Madina.\\n\\nThey observe only four main festivals, namely, Idul-Fitr, Idul-Azha, Yaum Al-Ashura and the \\nLailat-al Qadr and do\\n\\nnot observe Prophet Muhammad\\'s birthday (MiIad-un-Nabi) as a festival.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n9. Christianity\\n\\nChristianity is the religion of the followers of the teachings of Jesus Christ. Christianity has \\nthe largest adherents all\\n\\nover the world numbering more than 1.5 billion.\\n\\nOrigin\\n\\nJesus Christ was born as a Jew in Bethlehem in 4 BC. He was believed to have possessed supernatural \\npowers.\\n\\nHe began travelling widely and preaching to people in various towns. Alarmed by the growing \\npopularity of Jesus\\n\\nChrist and his preaching, some Jewish priests conspired to kill him and succeeded in having him \\ncrucified. On the\\n\\nthird day after his Crucifixion, Jesus was resurrected. He lived on earth for another 40 days and \\nthen ascended to\\n\\nheaven.\\n\\nThe incidents preceding and succeeding his birth matched the prophesies of the Old Testament, \\naccording to\\n\\nwhich, the son of God would be born on the earth to rid humanity of its sins. The followers of \\nJesus formed a new\\n\\nfaith, which was named as A?s/?aze\\'/ (after Christ) and its followers, O?s/raw.\\n\\nFundamental principles of Christianity\\n\\nChristians are monotheists and insist that the originator and preserver of creation is one but is \\nrepresented in the\\n\\nHoly Trinity, as the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Christians see God as the Lord of Israel \\nand the father of\\n\\nthe divine and human figure of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, was the eternal word of God who assumed \\nhuman form\\n\\nto serve humanity and to rescue the human beings. Jesus Christ suffered and died to redeem mankind \\nfrom sin.\\n\\nChristians also believe that Jesus Christ now sits at the right hand of God as the final judge of \\nthe dead, and that\\n\\nHe will return again as prophesised.\\n\\nChristians believe that Jesus Christ chose 12 learned men as messengers and directed them to spread \\nhis\\n\\nteachings and guide the populace. The 12 apt/es are Peter (Simon); his brother Andrew; James; and \\nhis brother\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nJohn; Philip and Bartholomew, the sons of Zebedee; Thomas and Matthew; James, son of AIphaaeus; \\nThaddaeus;\\n\\nSimon the Patriot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ.\\n\\nBible\\n\\nThe holy book of the Christians is the Bible. The Bible contains a collection of writings dating \\nfrom 9 BC to 1 AD\\n\\nwritten in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek and English. The Bible is divided into the Old Testament with 46 \\nbooks and the\\n\\nNew Testament with 27. The 7\\'d’ Tesfanez \\' is a Hebrew text, sacred to both the Jews and Christians \\nand\\n\\ncontains information about the creation of the world. The life and teachings of Jesus Christ, which \\nform the centre\\n\\nof Christian belief, are recorded in the 7Ié\\'w Tesfaz›ez \\'.\\n\\nChristian sects\\n\\nChristianity became the formal religion of the Roman Empire after Constantine, the Emperor of Rome, \\nconverted to\\n\\nChristianity in 313 AD. The religion was known as zgz/O/c or universal, with the Roman Pope as its \\nhead. By\\n\\n1054 AD many differences arose and the Church formally split into the ZBsYarzz zZ//aasIzr and the\\nwestern\\n\\n72z/zszz /gz/O?c schools.\\n\\nIn the 15th century, a new school of philosophy began to question the supremacy of the Pope. In the \\n16th century\\n\\nMartin Luther advocated many reforms in the Church, which led to yet another split in the Christian \\ncommunity and\\n\\nthe formation of &z¥’esz’azz’ churches across Northeast Europe. The Protestants disapproved of the \\nauthority of the\\nPope and advanced the cause of the Bible as the sole authority.\\n\\nChristianity in India\\n\\nBy tradition, Christianity is said to have arrived in South India with the arrival of St. Thomas, \\none of the apostles of\\n\\nJesus Christ, at the Malabar Coast in 52 AD. He spent some years in South India and died near \\nMadras. However,\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nothers believe that the first missionary to arrive in the country was Saint Bartholomew. \\nHistorically,\\nChristian\\n\\nmissionary activity started with the advent of St. Francis Xavier in 1544 AD.\\n\\n\\nThroughout the 18th and 19th centuries Catholic as well as Protestant missionaries preached \\nChristian doctrines in\\n\\nIndia and also made important contributions to social improvement and education in India.\\n\\nThe great period of expansion of Christianity in India began in 1858, when the British government \\ntook over rule in\\n\\nIndia from the East India Company. Christians from many countries came as missionaries.\\n\\nAt present Christians are scattered all across India but most of them are concentrated in the \\nNortheast and in\\n\\nKerala and other southern states. Today, there are 23 dioceses in India with 11 of them being \\nlocated in Kerala.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Christians belonging to the Syrian Church are found in South India and claim an apostolic \\nfoundation for their Church.\\nThey believe that Christianity was introduced in India by St. Thomas in 52 AD at the Malabar\\nCoast. He\\n\\nestablished seven Christian communities or churches in Kerala.\\n\\nThe Malabar Church renounced the authority of the Pope and asserted its independence in 1653 AD.\\nThis is known in history as the  2zxzev Nos  Zoe/a<a/7crz‘.\\n\\nThe Christian communities then split into many groups - East Syrian Catholics, West Syrian \\nCatholics,\\nSyrian Orthodox, Jacobite Syrian Orthodox, Marthoma, Church of the East and the Latin Church.\\n\\nToday, the Chaldean Syrian Church is one of four archbishoprics in the Assyrian Church of the East,\\nand has about 15,000 members in and around Thrissur City. Its cathedral is the Mart Mariam \\nCathedral, Thrissur City\\'s first Christian church.\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nWith the arrival of the Portuguese to India, the visits of Roman Catholic Missions to India became \\nmore\\norganised, and were initially concentrated to Goa, Cochin, Tuticorin and other coastal areas.\\n\\nSt. Francis Xavier (1506-52 AD) became the first Jesuit missionary to arrive in India.\\n\\nIn 1557 AD, Pope Paul IV declared Goa an archdiocese with its supremacy extending from the Cape of\\nGood Hope at the southern tip of Africa to China, and all Christians, including the East Syrian \\nChurch, brought under its jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\nThe first Protestant missionaries, German Lutherans, came to India in 1706 AD at Tranquebar, near\\nTiruchinapally, under the protection of the King of Denmark.\\n\\nBy the 19th century several other missions were established in different parts of South India.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome consider that St. Thomas had travelled to North India and introduced Christianity. Others \\nconsider it to be the influence of merchants from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.\\nUnder the influence of the Portuguese, several missionaries began to visit North India between \\n16th-\\n18th Centuries. The Jesuit missions were sent regularly to the Mughal Courts from the time of Akbar \\nto\\n\\nthat of Aurangzeb.\\n\\nWilliam Carey arrived in India in 1793 AD. Carey\\'s pioneering work in Bible translation, primary\\n\\neducation and journalism had a profound influence in Bengal and other parts of India. Numerous \\nother\\nmissionaries began visiting India after the passing of Charter Acts by the British Parliament in \\n1813 and 1833 AD.\\n10. Judaism\\n\\nJudaism is one of the oldest religions of the world, evolved in Egypt about 3,700 years ago. It \\nbelieves in the unity\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nand oneness of the universal Creator. Judaism is the religion, philosophy and way of life of the \\nJewish people.\\n\\nHistOry\\n\\nAccording to Jewish tradition,  a emwas the leader of a tribe named Habiru (Hebrew) in Chaldea in\\nabout 2000 BC. He advocated the theory of monotheism and decided to move his tribe to Canaan\\n\\n(Palestine) to propound his theory. Here, the Hebrews mixed freely with local people and eagerly \\nsought\\nconverts to their faith.\\n\\nAbraham\\'s grandson Jacob had an encounter with a mysterious being who told Jacob that in future, \\nhis\\nname would be known as ’/srae/’. The renamed Israel had 12 sons, who later became the progenitors \\nof\\n\\n12 tribes named after them. These tribes bore the collective name of   /szae/ or \\'Children of \\nIsrael’.\\n\\nThe Israelis grew in number and for approximately two centuries dwelt in Egypt, where they were \\nenslaved.\\nIn about 1200 BC, under the leadership of Ares, they escaped and wandered in the wastes of Sinai \\n(Egypt) for a long time. Here, Moses, the first Prophet of god, received revelation of the law, the \\nten Qruszz:dzez¥\\'s, which is today known as the &/ez Noah, the Jewish scripture.\\nAfter this, a kingdom was founded in Canaan with Jerusalem as its capital. In this city, a temple \\nwas built to\\nperform sacred rites.\\n\\nAfter King Solomon died, Israel was split into two kingdoms. The Southern Kingdom was made up of \\nthe\\ntribes of Judah and Benjamin and called Judah with Jerusalem as its capital.\\n\\nThe remaining 10 tribes comprised the Northern Kingdom. When the Assyrians invaded the Northern\\nKingdom, they scattered the Israelites to various parts of their empire, northeast of Israel. Today \\nthey are\\n\\nreferred to as the Z  /as/ /’z/  . The Scriptures suggest they will be identified and returned to \\nIsrael in the\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nLast Days.\\n\\nBeliefs and practices\\n\\nThe Jews believe in one god as was instituted by Abraham, Who they call Ca7 \\'l and from whom all \\ncreation\\nflows. Judaism believes in prophets, of whom Moses was the first. According to tradition, Moses \\nreceived the Ten\\n\\nCommandments from God. Every devout Jew follows these commandments till today.\\n\\nThe religion gives great importance to a good moral life and does not advocate asceticism, celibacy \\nor self-imposed\\n\\nsuffering, as it believes that the path to salvation is only through good deeds.\\n\\nThe religious scripture &/ex Tmah consists of the first five books of the Old Testament. There are \\n613 percepts in\\nthe Torah to regulate the daily life of every Jew and this number is symbolised in the threads of \\nthe prayer shawls\\n\\n(is/s//’ that every adult male Jew is enjoined to wear for prayers. The 7\"a/zzao\\', the body of \\nJewish law, is\\nconsidered Yahweh\\'s exclusive and immutable law. The @    is the Jewish place of worship.\\n\\nJewish sects\\n\\nThe Jews have three principle sects: Orthodox, Conservative, and Reformist.\\n\\nThe &//xx¥zr cling to all ancient traditions and forms of religious worship and practices\\n\\nThe founder of the 7g\\'/mzzzmovement adopted the philosophy of changing with the times, and \\nreligious\\nservices and rituals were considerably shortened.\\n\\nThe 6trzser /? ze Jews followed a middle path, retaining some features of the Orthodox groups but\\npermitting relaxation in certain cases.\\n\\nJudaism in India\\n\\nIt is commonly accepted that the Jews have been in India for over 2,000 years ever since they first\\nlanded on the\\n\\nWest coast of India. The Indian Jews are known as a peace-loving community. They follow the Hebrew \\ncalendar.\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Indian Jews have a special thanks giving ceremony known as ZZr a7 x to-7B@zzr i.e. ’gratitude \\nto Elijah the\\n\\nProphet’, on festive occasions. Indian Jews fall into five categories:\\n\\n1. Bene Israel — meaning Children of Israel. Marati speaking. Arrived in Maharashtra 2,100 years \\nago.\\n\\n2. Cochin Jews - arrived in India 2,500 years ago and settled down in Kerala as traders.\\n\\n3. Baghdadi Jews - Jews who came to India as traders from West Asia, mainly from Baghdad. They are\\n\\nsettled mainly in Mumbai, Pune and Kolkata.\\n\\n4. Bene Menashe - The Manipur Jews constitute a community which sees itself as descendants of the\\n\\nManasseh (Menashe) Tribe (which is one of the 10 lost tribes of Jews).\\n\\n5. Bene Ephraim - also called \"Telugu Jews\". They are a small group who speak Telugu. Their \\nobservance\\n\\nof Judaism dates to 1981.\\n\\n11. Zoroastrianism\\n\\nParsism or Zoroastrianism is about 2600 years old and finds its origin in Persia. The religion was \\nfounded by\\n\\nSpenta Zarathustra or Zoroaster, who is considered as the Prophet of the Parsis.\\nZoroastrian practice is based on the responsibility of every man and woman to choose between good \\nand evil, and to respect God\\'s creations.\\nZarathustra preached the oneness of god and believed that dna  7fdzz¥z was the one and only god, \\nwho is formless and has six great aspects called the  S- eas. These are Ardibehest, Bahman, \\nShahrivar, Spendarmad, Khordad and Amardad. The Parsis believe that the Ahura Mazda is eternally in \\nconflict with\\na W?z¿pzr or Ahirman, who represents the evil force.\\n\\nPractices\\n\\nThe Parsi place of worship is called the //xe /exp \\'e. Five daily prayers, usually hymns or z \\' zs \\nuttered by\\nProphet Zarathustra are said in the home or the temple, before a fire, which symbolizes the realm \\nof truth,\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nrighteousness and order. Fire is regarded as the son of Ahura Mazda, and represents god.\\n\\nIn Zorastriniasm, Z2z4 zus-zzas zz is the only method of corpse-destruction. This involves the \\ndestruction of the\\ndead body in the stone-enclosed Dakhma, by the flesh-eating bird or the rays of the Sun.\\n\\nReligious Scriptures\\n\\n\\'ezx s Pes/a is the religious scripture of the Parsis. It contains the teachings, sermons and \\nprayers composed by\\n\\nProphet Zoroaster and his disciples and followers. Avestha is also the name of the language in \\nwhich it is\\n\\ncomposed.\\n\\nIt is divided into five parts: the Yasna (worship with ceremony and offerings), the Videvdad (laws \\nagainst demons),\\n\\nthe Yashts (worship), the Khordeh Avestha, which comprises of selected portions of the Avestha and \\nforms the\\n\\nbook of daily prayers of the Zoroastrians, and the five Gathas - Ahunavaiti, Ushtavaiti, Spenta- \\nMainyu, Vohu-\\nKhshathra and Vashishta-lshti, which contain the 17 hymns of God received by Prophet Zarathushtra \\nby way of a\\n\\nDivine Revelation.\\n\\nSects\\n\\nThere are three principle sects among the Parsis: Shahenshai, Kadmi and Fasli. The only difference \\nbetween the\\n\\nthree sects is the calendar they adhere to.\\n\\nThe lbs/is follow the traditional Persian calendar\\nThe  7 a s eds calculate their calendar from the last Sassanian king, Yazdegard III The / ¥zfs \\nclaim their calendar is the oldest and most accurate.\\n\\nZoroastrians of India\\n\\nThe first Zoroastrians to enter India arrived on the Gujarat coast in the 10th century and by the \\n17th century, most\\n\\nof them had settled in Bombay. Today, there are approximately 90,000 Parsis in India and are \\nconcentrated largely\\n\\nin Maharashtra and Gujarat.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n12. The Bahai Faith\\n\\nThe Bahai Faith is a monotheistic religion founded by A/z\\'2’zz’//âA in 19th-century Persia. The \\nBahais believe that\\nthe ‘Promised One’ of all ages and peoples, Bahâ’u’llâh revealed himself in 1863. He dispatched one \\nof the\\n\\ndistinguished Bahai teachers, Jamal Effendi to India to spread the teachings of the Bahai faith in \\nthe years 1874-\\n\\n75.\\n\\nBeliefs and practices\\n\\nThe Bahais believe in the three cardinal principles - oneness of mankind, oneness of God and \\noneness of religion.\\n\\nBahais believe that throughout history the Creator has educated humanity through a series of Divine\\n\\nManifestations. These Manifestations include: Krishna, Buddha, Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Jesus and\\n\\nMuhammad. They believe that in the present age, God has revealed Himself through Bahaullah, whose \\nname\\n\\nmeans ‘The Glory of God’. He is regarded as their Prophet.\\n\\nThe Bahais work for the removal of prejudices based on caste, creed, religion, sex, colour, race \\nand language.\\n\\nThey advocate universal education and the inculcation of a scientific outlook among people.

The act of praying is described \\nas\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is obligatory for every Bahai to pray and meditate on the Words of God every day. There are \\nprayers for all\\n\\noccasions and these can be offered individually or collectively.\\n\\nThe Lotus Temple\\n\\nThe Bahai House of Worship at New Delhi is popularly known as the Lotus Temple. The temple gives \\nthe impression of a half-open lotus flower afloat, surrounded by its leaves. There is no clergy in \\nthe temple, no idols, no pictures, no sermons, no rituals. It is a place for communication between \\nman and his Creator, God.\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe shrine has been designed by a young architect, if\\'. W<r  z &  , a Canadian citizen and a Bahai \\nof Iranian descent, who was selected from among the world\\'s top architects.\\n2. Religious Pilgrimages of India\\n\\nAmarnath Yatra\\n\\nThe Cave of Amarnath is about 50 kilometers from Pahalgam in south Kashmir but\\n\\ninvolves tough walking, trekking and pony-riding. The cave is surrounded by snowy mountains. The \\ncave itself is covered with snow most time of the year except for a short period of time in summer \\nwhen it is open for pilgrims.\\nAccording to legend the cave is situated at the place where Lord Shiva had given\\n\\namrit (nectar) to the gods of the Hindu. It is believed that Lord Shiva adopted the shape of an \\nice-lingam which still exists in the cave.\\nThe Yatra was abandoned for a long time due to devastating floods and other natural calamities in \\nthe\\nvalley. A local Muslim family called Maliks is said to have re-discovered it. The successive \\ngenerations of\\n\\nthe Malik family of Mattan have since then been taking an active part in preparation of the Yatra \\nand they\\n\\nget a share of the offerings at the cave.\\n\\nThe Kashmiri labourers, invariably all Muslims, help the pilgrims throughout. The pilgrims traverse \\nthe route\\nchanting \"Har Har Mahadev\" and \"Amarnath Swami Ki Jai\". The Muslim helpers join them by saying \"Ya\\n\\nPeer Dastgeer\". The Yatra culimates on the full moon day of August.\\n\\nHajj\\n\\nNearly 3 million Muslims from more than 120 countries journey to the holy\\n\\ncity of Makkah each year to make the spiritual pilgrimage known as the Hajj. The pilgrimage is one \\nof five Pillars of Islam that form the framework of Islamic life.\\nMuslims trace the origin of the Haj to Prophet Ibrahim, who rebuilt the first\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nHouse of Allah, the 7 \\'aza, as the focal point for the worship of Allah alone.\\n\\nThe Hajj begins on the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic year, and lasts for\\nsix days,\\n\\nfrom 8th-12th of Dhul-Hijjah. For the first three days of the Haj, the pilgrims are required to \\nwear special\\n\\ngarments called /Eazzz\\n\\nUpon arrival in Makkah, the pilgrims go to the 7¥tzazzz  are/ (Holy mosque) and perform the \\n7*ai4eaf or\\nthe circumambulation around the Kaaba or the House of Allah.\\n\\nThe rituals also involve stoning (Rami) of the Max <a/ (Satan) on the 1Qh of Dhul-Hijjah, followed \\nby the\\nperformance of Tanah- e•W apart and & w at Makkah, which marks the culmination of the main rituals \\nof\\nthe Hajj.\\n\\nIn India, the Ministry of External Affairs is the nodal agency which is responsible for making \\narrangements\\nfor the Indians Hajjis. Nearly 1,72,000 Indian pilgrims are going every year to perform Hajj. In \\naddition, nearly 80,000 Indian pilgrims visit Saudi Arabia every year to perform the lesser \\npilgrimage known as\\n\\n\\nKumbh Mela\\nKumbh Mela is the greatest riverside religious festival of Hindus that takes place once every three \\nyears. However, the major Maha Kumbh Mela occurs once in\\n\\n12 years.\\n\\nLegend has it that Lord Vishnu saved the nectar (Amrut) from the demons and gave it to the gods in \\na pot. The gods rested the pot at each of the four cities of Allahabad, Haridwar, Ujjain, and \\nNasik.\\nA few drops of Nectar are supposed to have spilled over on the water at these four places and \\nsages,\\nsaints and pilgrims started periodically to flock to each of these \\'Tirthas\\' to celebrate the \\ndivine event.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThousands of devotees take a holy dip in the river that is believed to purge them of their sin.\\n\\nRecorded history is witness to the fact that the Kumbh festival has been celebrated since even \\nbefore the\\nsecond century BC. Ayyappa Temple\\nThe hill temple of Lord Awappa in Shabarimala is situated in the Western Ghats of Kerala.\\nThe temple is open to all devotees irrespective of caste, creed, religion or social\\n\\nstatus. It attracts millions of pilgrims from within and outside India every year. Lord Ayyappa is \\nalso described as Hariharaputra, the son of Vishnu and Shiva, born in a supernatural way to \\nannihilate the demoness Mahishi.\\nThe idol of Ayyappa is believed to have been installed at Sabrimala on the day of Makar Sankranti \\n(mid-\\nJanuary). Devotees believe that on this day, a peculiar light called ‘Ahara Id\\'/a z/ or d aza- \\nz¥‘r\\' is\\nseen facing the deity over the hills and they eagerly await this blissful sight.\\n\\nThe Makara Vilakku is preceded by the period of dzz¥t/azz7which is a 41-day long ritualistic\\nworship\\n\\nduring which the pilgrims observe strict discipline and rigid austerities like wearing black \\nclothes, observing\\n\\nstrict celibacy and avoiding meat and alcohol.\\n\\nGirls and women between 10 and 50 years of age are not allowed to visit the temple to facilitate \\nstrict\\nobservance of celibacy in the temple complex.\\n\\nOnly those pilgrims who have observed the austerities for at least 41 days are allowed to use the \\n73z/?zerY/‘azp¥zc (or the 18 steps) leading to the main sanctum sanctorum.\\nThe devotees greet one another as  Aezipe &<azzzxzz  a  .\\n\\nPushkar Mela\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\nThe Pushkar Fair is held in the month of Kartik on the full moon day in Pushkar. Pushkar is home to \\none of the only two temples dedicated to Brahma, the other being at\\nKhedbrahma in\\n\\nKerala. It is one of the innumerable temples skirting the large Pushkar Lake.\\n\\nThe Pushkar fair centres around the event of taking a dip in the Pushkar Lake on the full moon \\nnight. Due\\nto its association with Brahma, Pushkar is considered to be the z’r</ zr a, the king of all \\npilgrimage sites.\\n\\nThe nearby temple of Savitri also attracts many married women, especially from Bengal, who\\nworship the\\n\\ngoddess and seek the boon of eternal company with their spouse.\\n\\nPushkar is also the site for the biggest cattle fair in India. Scholars suggest that the cattle \\nfair was an extension of the religious event of taking a dip in the lake.\\nUrs of Khwaja Moin-Ud-Din Chishti\\n\\nKhwaja Moinuddin Chishti, the founder of the Chishti order, came to India from\\n\\nPersia as a member of Muhammad Gouri\\'s invading army in 1191. He settled in Ajmer, where he \\npreached Islam until his death in 1233 AD. A darga was built in his memory. Affectionately called \\nzBz/6 7Ié\\'uz, he was said to be an emancipator of the poor.\\nEach year an Urs is celebrated is celebrated in the month of Rajab to commemorate the death \\nanniversary\\n\\nof Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti. According to the legend, the Khwaja entered his cell on the first day \\nof the\\n\\nmonth of Rajab to meditate for five days and died on the sixth day.\\n\\nDuring this six-day fair, which is attended by people of different communities, various ceremonies \\nare\\nperformed and the Qawwalis are sung in praise of the Khwaja.\\n\\nThe tomb is known for its power to fulfill wishes. Devotees tie a la/acs on the pillars when \\nseeking\\na\\n\\nfavour. They are expected to untie the knot once their request has been granted.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n3. National Symbols of India\\n\\n13. National Flag\\n\\nThe National flag is a horizontal tri-colour of deep saffron (kesari) at the top, white in\\n\\nthe middle and dark green at the bottom in equal proportion. The saffron stands for courage, \\nsacrifice and the spirit of renunciation; the white stands for purity and truth and the green for \\nfaith and fertility.\\nThe ratio of width of the flag to its length is two to three. In the centre of the white\\n\\nband is a navy blue wheel which has 24 spokes. Its diameter approximates the width of the white \\nband. Its\\n\\ndesign is taken from that of the wheel which appears on the abacus of the Lion Capital of Ashoka at \\nSarnath.\\nThe design of the national flag was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 22 July 1947.\\n\\nThe Flag Code of India, 2002, has taken effect from 26 January 2002 and supercedes the ‘Flag Code - \\nas\\nit existed. The Flag Code of India, 2002 is an attempt to bring together all such laws, \\nconventions, practices\\n\\nand instructions for the guidance and benefit of all concerned.\\n\\nThere shall be no restriction on the display of the National Flag by members of general public, \\nprivate\\norganisations, educational institutions, etc., except to the extent provided in the Emblems and \\nNames\\n\\n(Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 \\nand any\\n\\nother law enacted on the subject.\\n\\n14. State Emblem\\n\\nThe state emblem depicts four lions, standing back to back. It is an adaptation from the Sarnath\\n\\nLion Capital of Ashoka, near Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. Carved out of a single block of polished \\nsandstone, the capital is crowned by the Wheel of the Law (Dharma Chakra).\\nThe Lion Capital was erected in the third century BC by Emperor Ashoka to mark the spot where \\nBuddha first proclaimed his gospel of peace and emancipation to the four quarters of the\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nuniverse.\\n\\nIn the State emblem, adopted by the Government of India on 26 January 1950, only three lions are \\nvisible, the fourth being hidden from view.\\nThe four lions symbolizing power, courage and confidence, rest on a circular abacus. The abacus is \\ngirdled\\nby four smaller animals -- guardians of the four directions: the lion of the north, the elephant of \\nthe east, the\\n\\nhorse of the south and the bull of the west. The abacus rests on a lotus in full bloom, \\nexemplifying the fountainhead of life and creative inspiration.\\nThe words Satyameva Jayate (meaning \\'truth alone tirumphs’) from Mundaka Upanishad are inscribed\\nbelow the abacus in Devanagari script.\\n\\nThe use of the state emblem of India, as the official seal of the Government of India, is regulated \\nby the\\nstate of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005.\\n\\n15. National Anthem\\n\\nThe song Jana-gana-mana, composed originally in Bengali by Rabindranath\\n\\nTagore, was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly as the national anthem of \\nIndia on Tuesday, 24 January f950.\\nRabindranath Tagore wrote it at the request of his intimate friend Ashutosh\\n\\nChaudhari, a judge of the Calcutta High Court, for singing at the 26th session of the Indian \\nNational Congress on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta Session of the Indian National Congress.\\nPlaying time of the full version of the National Anthem is approximately 52\\n\\nseconds. A short version consisting of the first and last lines of the stanza (playing time \\napproximately 20 seconds) is also played on certain occasions.\\n16. National Song\\n\\n\\n\\nhis\\nThe song Vande Mataram, composed in Sanskrit by Bankimchandra Chatterji, was incorporated in\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nfamous novel Ananda Math (1882). It has an equal status with the National Anthem.\\n\\nLater the song was set to tune by Rabindranath Tagore and sung for the first time before the \\ngathering at\\nthe 12th annual session of the Indian National Congress held in 1896 in Calcutta.\\nIt was declared as the National Song in 1937 through a resolution. The English translation of the \\nstanza was rendered by Sri Aurobindo.\\n\\n17. National Calendar\\n\\nThe National Calendar is based on the Saka Era with Chaitra being its first month.\\nIt consists of 365 days in a normal year. It was adopted from\\n\\n22nd March 1957 along with the Gregorian calendar for the following official purposes: Gazette of \\nIndia; news broadcast by All India Radio; calendars issued by Government of India; and, Government \\ncommunications addressed to the members of the public.\\nDates of the National Calendar correspond with those of the\\n\\nGreogrian Calendar. Thus, the first day of Chaitra corresponds to 22nd March in a normal year and \\n21 March in leap year.\\n18. National Animal\\n\\nThe Tiger - Panthera tigris (linnaeus), is the national animal of India. It is a rich-colored\\n\\nwell-striped animal with a short coat. The combination of grace, strength, power has earned the \\ntiger great respect and high esteem.\\nOut of eight races of the species known, the Indian race, the Royal Bengal Tiger, is\\n\\nfound throughout the country except in the north-western region and also in the neighbouring \\ncountries, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.\\n19.

The female is brownish, \\nslightly smaller than the male and lacks the trail.\\nThe elaborate courtship dance of the male, fanning out the tail and preening its feathers is a \\ngorgeous\\nsight.\\n\\n20. National Flower\\n\\nLotus or waterlily is an acquatic plant of Nymphaea with broad flaoting leaves and bright fragrant \\nflowers that grow only in shallow waters.\\nIt is a sacred flower and occupies a unique position in the art and mythology of ancient\\n\\nIndia and has been an auspicious symbol of Indian culture since time immemorial.\\n\\n21. National Fruit\\n\\nMango (Manigifera indica) is the National fruit of India. Mango is one of the most widely\\n\\ngrown fruits of the tropical countries. In India, mango is cultivated almost in all parts, with the \\nexception of hilly areas.\\nMango is a rich source of Vitamins A, C and D.\\n\\nMangoes have been cultivated in India from time immemorial. The poet Kalidasa sang of its\\n\\npraises. Alexander savoured its taste, as did the Chinese pilgrim Hieun Tsang. Akbar planted \\n100,000 mango trees in Darbhanga, known as Lakhi Bagh.\\n22. National Tree\\n\\nThe Banyan Tree (Ficus benghalensis) is the National Tree of India.\\n\\nThis huge tree towers over its neighbours and has the widest reaching roots of all known trees, \\neasily covering several acres. It sends off new shoots from its roots, so that one tree is really a \\ntangle of branches, roots, and trunks.\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n23. National aquatic animal\\n\\nThe Gangetic Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) is the National aquatic animal of India. The Ganges \\nriver dolphin is primarily found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers.\\nGangatic Dolphin is said to represent the purity of the holy Ganga as it can only survive in pure \\nand fresh water.\\nIt is listed by the IUCN as endangered on their Red List of Threatened Species.\\n\\n24. National Currency Symbol\\n\\nThe symbol is an amalgam of Devanagari \"Ra\" and the Roman Capital \"R\" with two parallel horizontal \\nstripes running at the top representing the national flag and also the \"equal to\" sign.\\nThe Indian Rupee sign was adopted by the Government of India on 15th July, 2010.\\n\\nThe symbol of Indian Rupee signifies India\\'s international identity for money transactions and \\neconomic strength.\\nThe symbol, conceptualised and designed by Udaya Kumar, a post graduate in Design from Indian \\nInstitute\\nof Technology Bombay, has been chosen from thousands of concept entries received by the Ministry of\\n\\nFinance through an open competition among resident Indian nationals.\\n\\n25. National Heritage animal\\n\\nThe Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) has been declared as the national heritage animal by \\nthe\\ngovernment in order to conserve its dwindling population.\\n\\n60% of the Asian elephants live in India. There are over 25,000 elephants in the\\n\\ncountry, including 3,500 in captivity in zoos and temples - particularly in southern and \\nnorth-eastern parts of the country.\\nIndian Elephant has been listed as endangered by IUCN as the population has\\n\\ndeclined by at least 50% over the last three generations\\n\\n26. National game\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports of India clarified that, officially, the country does not \\nhave a national\\ngame, no game, including hockey, has been notified as such.\\n\\nHowever, many sources, including the Indian government\\'s official portal, mention hockey as a \\n\"National\\nGame\".\\n\\nIndia has won eight Olympic gold medals for hockey. Indian hockey\\'s golden period was from 1928—56,\\nwhen the Indian hockey team won six successive Olympic gold medals.\\n\\n4. Languages\\n\\nIn India there are 22 scheduled languages, 114 other languages, 216 mother tongues, 96 non \\nspecified languages\\n\\nand totally up to 10000 languages spoken by the people.\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nIndian languages have evolved from different stocks and are closely associated with the different \\nethnic groups of\\n\\nIndia. Broadly the Indian languages can be put into six groups: 1) Indo-Aryan, 2) Dravidian, 3) \\nSino- Tibetan, 4)\\n\\nNegroid, S) Austric and 6) Others. These languages have interacted on one another through the \\ncenturies and\\n\\nhave produced the major linguistic divisions of modern India. The Indo-Aryan and the Dravidian are\\nthe dominant\\n\\ngroups and together comprises all the major languages of India.\\n\\n1. Indo-Aryan:\\n\\nIt is part of the Indo-European family of languages, which came to India with the Aryans.\\n\\nIt is the biggest of the language groups in India and accounts for about 74% of the total Indian \\npopulation.\\n\\nIt comprises of all the principal languages of northern and western India such as Hindi, Bengali,\\nMarathi,\\nGujarati, Punjabi, Sindhi, Rajasthani, Assamese, Oriya, Pahari, Bihari, Kashmiri, Urdu and \\nSanskrit.\\n\\n2. Dravidian:\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThis is the second most important group and comprises mainly of languages spoken in the Southern \\nIndia.\\nIt covers about 25% of the Indian population.\\n\\nProto-Dravidian gave rise to 21 Dravidian Languages. They can be broadly classified into three \\ngroups:\\nNorthern group, Central group, and Southern group of Dravidian languages.\\n\\nThe 7Kzr/\\'zzz   consists of three languages i.e. Brahui, Malto and Kudukh. Brahui is spoken\\nin\\n\\nBaluchistan, Malto spoken in Bengal and Orissa, while Kurukh is spoken in Bengal, Orissa, Bihar and \\nMadhya Pradesh.\\nThe C rYza/  zxrp consists of eleven languages viz., Gondi, Khond, Kui, Manda, Parji, Gadaba, \\nKolami,\\nPengo, Naiki, Kuvi and Telugu. Out of these, only Telugu became a civilized language and the rest \\nremained tribal languages.\\nThe scxa’ zzz ¿;  consists of seven languages viz., Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Tulu, Kodagu,\\nToda\\n\\nand Kota.\\n\\nThe major languages of the Dravidian group are: (i) Telugu (numerically the biggest of the \\nDravidian\\nlanguages), (ii) Tamil (oldest and purest language of the Dravidian family), (iii) Kannada and (iv)\\nMalayalam\\n\\n(smallest and the youngest of the Dravidian family).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Sino-Tibetan:\\n\\nThe Sino-Tibetan or Mongoloid family stretches all over the sub-Himalayan tracts, covering North \\nBihar,\\nNorth Bengal, Assam up to the north-eastern frontiers of the country.\\n\\nThese languages are considered to be older than the Indo-Aryan languages and are referred to in the\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\noldest Sanskrit literature as S<a/as.\\n\\nThe Tibeto-Burman languages are divided into four broad groups:\\n\\n{/} 77\\'  zz. Sikkimese, Bhotia, Balti, Sherpa, Lahuli and Ladakhi\\n\\n{/z“} Hsia/ayan.- Kanauri and Limbu\\n\\n{/\\'i“/} 7IAr/ z•  azzr Abor (Adi), Miri, Aka, Dafla and Mishmi\\n\\n/? xg Maznloziese.- It is again sub-divided into four main sub-groups, viz. Kuki-Chin, Mikir, Bodo \\nand Naga. Manipuri or Meithi is the most important language of the Kuki-Chin sub-group. The Bodo \\nsub-group includes such dialects as Bodo, Rajbangsi, Koch, Mech, Rabha, Dimasa, Kachari, Chutiya, \\nGaro, Haijong and the Tipra (Tirupuri). Mikir has strong affinities to the Bodo and is spoken in \\nthe Mikir Hills and Parts of Sibsagar district in Assam. The principal languages of the Naga \\nsub-group are Angami, Sema, Ao, Lotha, Mao, Konyak, Kabui and Lepcha.\\n4. Austric:\\n\\nThe Austric languages of India belong to the Austro-Asiatic sub-family, which are represented by\\n\\nlanguages of the Munda or Kol Group, spoken in the central, eastern and north-eastern India and \\nlanguages of the Mon-Khmer group like Khasi and Nicobarese.\\nThese are very ancient languages which have been in existence much before the advent of Aryans and\\nwere referred in ancient Sanskrit literature as 7I/saz¥zs.\\n\\nThe most important language of the Austric group is &z \\' e//, which is spoken by over 5 million \\nSanthals\\nand is the largest spoken among the Adivasi languages.\\n\\ndrx¥zz?, spoken by about a million Mundas, is another important language of this group.\\n\\n5. Others:\\n\\nThis group incudes several Dravidian adivasi languages like Gondi, Oraon or Kurukh, MaI-\\nPahariya, Khond\\n\\nand Parji which are very distinct and cannot be classified in other groups. Pali and Prakrit\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nPali and Prakrit are the languages that belong to the Middle Indo-Aryan period i.e. 600 BC-1000 AD.\\nPrakrit was\\n\\nthe Indo-Aryan speech which was in the form of uncultivated popular dialects. Prakrit came down to \\nus in\\n\\ninscriptions dating back to 4-3 BC. Practically all over India, Prakrits were freely used for \\ninscriptions almost up to\\n\\nthe Gupta age.\\n\\nIn the course of time, the Prakrits were transformed into what are known as the  Zz razzsa \\ndialects, which were\\n\\nwidely used in popular and folk literature. The various Prakrit dialects described by Prakrit \\ngrammarians are\\n\\nMaharastri, Sauraseni, Magadhi, Paisaci and Apabhramsa. Pali and Ardha-Magadhi are also Prakrits \\nand were\\n\\nused in early Buddhist and Jain literature. The Satavahana rulers were great patrons of Prakrit.\\n\\nThe earliest of the Buddhist literature is in Pali. Some consider Pali as Magadhi Prakrit or \\nMagadhi- bhasa, while\\n\\nothers point to a close relationship of Pali with Paisaci Prakrit spoken at that time in the \\nVindhya region. The\\n\\nTripitakas; Milindapanha; Petakopadesa and Visuddhimagga are some early works in Pali.\\n\\nThere is no consensus for a specific time where the modern north Indian languages such as \\nHindustani,\\n\\nAssamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Sindhi and Oriya emerged, but AD 1000 is\\ncommonly\\n\\naccepted.\\n\\nThe Dravidian languages of South India had a history independent of Sanskrit. Though Malayalam and \\nTelugu are\\n\\nDravidian in origin, over eighty percent of their lexicon is borrowed from Sanskrit. The Kannada \\nand Tamil\\n\\nlanguages have lesser Sanskrit and Prakrit influence. The Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman languages \\nof North-\\n\\nEast India also have long independent histories.\\n\\nOfficial Languages\\n\\nEnglish was the only language used for official purpose in the British India. In the independent \\nIndia, it was\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\ndeclared in Article 343 (1) that Hindi will be the official Union language. It was also mentioned \\nthat over a period of\\n\\nfifteen years since the commencement of the Indian Constitution, Hindi will replace English as the \\nofficial language.\\n\\nHowever, the Parliament can decide whether to use English as an official language or not.\\n\\nThe non-Hindi speaking communities across the country protested on the aspect of the change in \\nofficial language\\nfrom English to Hindi. This protest resulted in the enactment of the Official Language Act, 1963.\\nAccording to the\\n\\nact, Hindi in Devanagari script has been declared the official language of the Union. However, \\nEnglish may also be\\n\\nused for official purposes even after 1965. English has been given the status of the ’szrzzsrz az\\n\\n\\nof India. It was decided that either Hindi or English can be used for procedures of Parliament. It \\nshould be noted that there is no national language of India. Hindi is not a national language. \\nNeither the Constitution of India, nor any Indian law defines any national language.\\nIn the Constitution of India, there is a provision made for each of the Indian states to choose \\ntheir own official\\n\\nlanguage for communicating at the state level. The selected languages, which can be used for \\nofficial purpose,\\n\\nhave been listed in the &j;dd/z A7 nsfr/e to the Constitution. At present there are 22 languages in \\nthe Eighth\\n\\nschedule. Initially there were 14 languages.

TAMIL - Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu.\\n\\n21. TELUGU - Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh\\n\\n22. URDU - Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh\\n\\nHowever the constitution does not specify the official languages to be used by the states for the \\nconduct of their\\nofficial functions, and leaves each state free to adopt any language used in its territory as its \\nofficial language or\\n\\nlanguages. 7 e /azgc j;e ze¥ad\\'zzz/‘ Ze  c¥° liaise /rs/ed\\'?zz /W &j;dz/\\' z the, and several states \\nhave\\n\\nadopted official languages which are not so listed. Examples include Kokborok in Tripura, Mizo in \\nMizoram, Khasi,\\n\\nGaro, and Jaintia in Meghalaya, and French in Puducherry.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nClassical language status\\n\\nIn 2004, the Government of India declared that languages that met certain requirements could be \\naccorded the\\n\\nstatus of a \"Classical Language in India\".\\n\\nThe following criteria were laid down to determine the eligibility of languages to be considered \\nfor classification as a\\n\\n\"Classical Language\":\\n\\nHigh antiquity of its early texts/recorded history over a period of 1500-2000 years\\n\\nA body of ancient literature/texts, which is considered a valuable heritage by generations of \\nspeakers\\n\\nThe literary tradition be original and not borrowed from another speech community\\nThe classical language and literature being distinct from modern, there may also be a discontinuity \\nbetween the classical language and its later forms or its offshoots.\\n\\nTamil became the first language in India to attain the status of classical language in 2004. In \\n2005,\\nSanskrit, which\\n\\nalready had special status in Article 351 of the Constitution of India as the primary source \\nlanguage for the\\n\\ndevelopment of the official standard of Hindi, was also declared to be a classical language. \\nKannada and Telugu\\n\\nwere accorded the status in 2008, based on the recommendation of a committee of linguistic experts \\nconstituted by\\n\\nthe Ministry of Culture, Government of India.\\n\\n5. Architecture\\n\\n27. Indus Valley Civilization\\n\\nThe Indus civilization flourished during the Bronze Age i.e. 2500-2000 BC. Extensive excavation \\nwork has so far\\n\\nidentified more than 100 sites belonging to this civilization. Some of the important sites are \\nDholavira (Gujarat),\\n\\nKalibangan (Rajasthan), Lothal (Gujarat), Sarkotada (Gujarat), Diamabad (Maharashtra), Alamgirpur \\n(U.P.),\\n\\nBhagwanpura (Haryana), Banawali (Haryana), Kuntasi, Padri (Gujarat) and Mauda (Jammu). The first of \\nits cities to\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nbe unearthed was located at Harappa, excavated in the 1920s in the Punjab province of British India \\n(now in\\n\\nPakistan).\\n\\nCharacteristic features\\n\\nThe Indus Valley is one of the world\\'s earliest urban civilizations, along with its contemporaries, \\nMesopotamia and\\n\\nAncient Egypt. At its peak, the Indus Civilization may have had a population of well over five \\nmillion.\\nExtensive ice+\\'z /\\'a  Mgr was the characteristic of this civilization, which is\\n\\nevident from the gridiron pattern for the layout of cities, some with fortifications and the \\nelaborate drainage and water management systems.\\nThe grid layout planning of the cities with xczzzdz a/ erac/ zrj;dd azg;d\\'es is a modern system \\nthat was implemented in the cities of this particular civilization.\\nThe houses were built of Ze4ed\\'&rc4s. Bricks of fixed sizes, as well as stone and wood were also \\nused for building.\\nBuildings in the lower area are rather monotonous, being mainly functional rather than decorative.\\n\\nThe most imposing of the buildings is the zzea/ Zb/ z c¥°  e a zoo It is 54.86 metres long and \\n32.91\\nmetres wide and with 2.43 metres thick outer walls. The Bath had galleries and rooms on all sides.\\n\\nAnother important structure was the &azzzz cogs¥\\'ew comprising of blocks with an overall area of 55 \\nx 43\\nmetres. The granaries were intelligently constructed, with strategic air ducts and platforms \\ndivided into units.\\n28. The Mauryan Period\\n\\nOther than the remnants of Indus valley civilization, the earliest surviving architectural heritage \\nin India is that of the\\n\\nMauryans.\\n\\nInitial period\\n\\nSome of the monuments and pillars belonging to this period are considered as the finest specimens \\nof Indian art.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Mauryan architecture was embalmed in timber, for rocks and stones were not as freely in use \\nthen. The art of\\n\\npolishing of wood reached so much perfection during the Mauryan period that master craftsmen used \\nto make\\n\\nwood glisten like a mirror.\\n\\nIn 300 B.C., Chandragupta Maurya constructed a «onsg\\'zz let  14.48 km long and 2.41km wide, along \\nthe Ganges\\nin Bihar. However, only a couple of teak beams have survived from this fort.\\n\\nAshoka\\n\\nAshoka was the first Mauryan Emperor who began the six  axc@/ec/zzze. The stonework of the Ashokan \\nPeriod\\n\\n(3rd century B.C.) was of a highly diversified order and comprised of lofty free-standing pillars, \\nrailings of the\\n\\nstupas, lion thrones and other colossal figures. While most of the shapes and decorative forms \\nemployed were\\n\\nindigenous in origin, some exotic forms show the influence of Greek, Persian and Egyptian cultures.\\n\\nThe Ashokan period marked the beginning of the Buddhist School of architecture in India. It \\nwitnessed the\\n\\nconstruction of many rock-cut caves, pillars, stupas and palaces. A number of cave-shrines \\nbelonging to this period\\n\\nhave been excavated in the Zb<aZzzr and 7lég¥zyzzl  //s and  /’azo\\'<  in Bihar. The caves are are \\nsimple in plan\\nand are devoid of all interior decorative carvings. They served as the residences of the monks.\\n\\nThere are several inscriptions, which indicate that these rock-cut sanctuaries were constructed by \\nEmperor\\n\\nAshoka for the monks of the @?v?4a sect, who are more closely related to the Jains than to the \\nBuddhists.\\n\\nThe Ashokan rock-edict at Z7 zzd/, near Bhubaneshwar, is considered to be the earliest rock-cut \\nsculpture in India.\\nIt has a sculpied elephant on the top, which signifies the Emperor\\'s conversion to Buddhism after \\nhis Kalinga\\n\\nVlCtOF\\'/.\\n\\nAshokan Pillars\\n\\nThe monolithic Ashokan pillars are marvels of architecture and sculpture. These were lofty free\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nstanding monolithic columns erected on sacred sites. Each pillar was about 15.24 metres high and\\n\\nweighed about 50 tonnes and was made out of fine sandstone. They carried declarations from the king\\n\\nregarding Buddhism or any other topic. The pillars have four component parts.\\n\\n(i) 7Zr\\' s7z\\'z/is are always plain and smooth, circular in cross-section, slightly tapering upwards \\nand always chiselled out of a single piece of stone.\\n(ii) 7 e cap:r\\'/’a/s have the shape and appearance of a gently arched bell formed of lotus petals.\\n\\n(iii) Zoe aza r are of two types: square and plain and circular and decorated and these are of \\ndifferent proportions.\\n(iv) 7Zr\\' c<  Mgr azr\\'x is are either seated or standing, always in the round and chiseled as a \\nsingle piece\\nwith the abaci.\\n\\nThe &zzzz/A @/law is one of the finest pieces of sculpture of the Ashokan period erected in 250 BC.\\nHere, four lions\\n\\nare seated back to back. The four lions symbolize power, courage, confidence and pride. This Lion\\nCapital of\\n\\nAshoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the National Emblem of India and the wheel \"Ashoka Chakra\" \\nfrom its\\n\\nbase was placed onto the centre of the National Flag of India. At present the Column remains in the \\nsame place\\n\\nwhere as Lion Capital is at the Sarnath Museum. The Stupas\\nStupa is a mound-like structure containing Buddhist relics, typically the ashes of deceased, used \\nby Buddhists as a\\n\\nplace of meditation. Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several stupas, which were \\nlarge halls, capped\\n\\nwith domes and bore symbols of the Buddha. The most important ones are located at Bharhut, \\nBodhgaya, Sanchi,\\n\\nAmravati and Nagarjunakonda.\\n\\nBuilt for a variety of reasons, Buddhist stupas are classified based on form and function into five \\ntypes:\\n\\n1. 7Z\\'/re &zz/zz - in which the relics or remains of the Buddha, his disciples and lay saints are \\ninterred.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n2. Object stupa - in which the items interred are objects belonged to the Buddha or his disciples \\nsuch as a\\n\\nbegging bowl or robe, or important Buddhist scriptures.\\n\\n3. z2zmwz/ora// ze s/’zr  - built to commemorate events in the lives of Buddha or his disciples.\\n\\n4. @  ie s/zz,oa - to symbolise aspects of Buddhist theology, for example, Borobuddur is considered \\nto be\\nthe symbol of \"the Three Worlds (dhatu) and the spiritual stages (bhumi) in a Mahayana \\nbodhisattva\\'s character.\"\\n5. I ¥‘?ze s/zz  - constructed to commemorate visits or to gain spiritual benefits, usually at the \\nsite of\\nprominent stupas which are regularly visited.\\n\\nThe shape of the stupar  esez \\'s /7\\'e   , crowned and sitting in meditation posture on a lion \\nthrone. His crown is the top of the spire; his head is the square at the spire\\'s base; his body is \\nthe vase shape; his legs are the four steps of the lower terrace; and the base is his throne. The \\nstupa represent the five purified elements:\\nThe square base represents earth\\n\\nThe hemispherical dome/vase represents water The conical spire represents fire\\nThe upper lotus parasol and the crescent moon represents air The sun and the dissolving point \\nrepresents the element of space\\n\\n\\nApart from the than ruins of stupa at Piprahwa (Nepal), the core of stupa No 1 at Sanchi can be \\nconsidered\\nas the oldest of the stupas.\\n\\nOriginally built by Asoka, it was enlarged in subsequent centuries. An inscription by the ivory \\ncarvers of\\nVidisha on the southern gateway throws light on the transference of building material from \\nperishable\\nwood\\nand ivory to the more durable stone.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nAmaravati stupa, built in 2nd or 1st century BC was probably like the one at Sanchi, but in later \\ncenturies it\\nwas transformed from a Hinayana shrine to a Mahayana shrine.\\n\\nAmaravati stupa is different from the Bharhut and Sanchi stupas. It had free-standing columns \\nsurmounted\\nby lions near the gateways. The dome was covered with sculptured panels.\\n\\nThe stupa had an upper circumambulatory path on the drum as at Sanchi. This path had two \\nintricately\\ncarved railings. The stone is greenish-white limestone of the region.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Bharhut stupa may have been established by the Maurya king Asoka in the 3rd century BCE, but\\nmany works of art were apparently added during the Sunga period, with many friezes from the 2nd \\ncentury\\n\\nBCE.\\n\\nThe stupa (now dismantled and reassembled at Kolkata Museum) contains numerous birth stories of the\\nBuddha\\'s previous lives, or Jataka tales.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Gandhara stupa is a further development of stupas at Sanchi and Bharhut.\\n\\nIn Gandhara stupas the base, dome and the hemisphere dome are sculpted. The stupa tapers\\nupward to\\n\\nform a tower like structure.\\n\\nThe stupas of Nagarjunakonda in Krishna valley were very large. At the base there were brick walls\\nforming wheel and spokes, which were filled with earth. The Maha Chaitya of Nagarjunakonda has a \\nbase\\n\\nin the form of Swastika, which is a sun symbol.\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n29. The Sungas, Kushans and Satavahanas\\n\\nAfter the death of Ashoka Mauryan dynasty came to an end and the Sungas and Kushans ruled in the \\nnorth and\\n\\nthe Satavahanas in the south. These dynasties made advances in art and architecture in areas like \\nstone\\n\\nconstruction, stone carving, symbolism and beginning of temple (or c/zzr/’ a /zz//) and the \\nmonastery (or v/Sena)\\n\\nconstructions.\\n\\nThe period between 2nd century B.C. and 3rd century A.D. marked the beginning of the sculptural \\nidiom in Indian\\n\\nsculpture where the elements of physical form were evolving into a more refined, realistic and \\nexpressive style.\\n\\nUnder these dynasties the Asokan stupas were enlarged and the earlier brick and wood works were\\nreplaced with stone-works. The Sanchi Stupa was enlarged to nearly twice its size in 150 B.C. and\\n\\nelaborate gateways were added later. The Sungas reconstructed the railings around the Barhut Stupa \\nand\\n\\nbuilt the toranas or the gateways.\\n\\nThe Satavahanas constructed a large number of stupas at Goli, Jaggiahpeta, Bhattiprolu, Gantasala,\\nNagarjunakonda and Amravati.\\n\\nDuring the Kushan period, the Z o£ e  ze esem\\'ed’?zz zzzszr /mzrzinstead of symbols.\\nBuddha\\'s\\n\\nimage in endless forms and replicas became the principal element in Buddhist sculpture during the \\nKushan\\n\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe Kushans were the pioneers of the Gandhara School of Art and a large number of monasteries;\\nstupas\\n\\nand statues were constructed during the reign of Kanishka.\\n\\n30. The Schools of Art\\n\\nThe Gandhara School of Art (50 B.C. to 500 A.D.)\\n\\nThe Gadhara region extending from Punjab to the borders of Afghanistan was an important centre of\\nMahayana\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nBuddhism up to the Sth century A.D. The region became famous throughout the world since a new \\nschool of Indian\\n\\nsculpture known as the Gandhara School developed during that period. Owing to its strategic \\nlocation the\\n\\nGandhara School imbibed all kinds of foreign influences like Persian, Greek, Roman, Saka and \\nKushan.\\n\\nThe Gandhara School of Art is also known as the taeco-bsl W << \\' of Art since Greek techniques of \\nArt were applied to Buddhist subjects. The most important contribution of the Gandhara School of \\nArt was the evolution of beautiful images of the Buddha and Bodhisattavas, which were executed in \\nblack stone and modelled on identical characters of Graeco-Roman pantheon. Hence it is said, \"the \\nGandhara artist had the hand of a Greek but the heart of an Indian.\"\\nThe important characteristics of Gandhara school are: Depiction of Lord Buddha in the standing or \\nseated positions.\\nThe seated Buddha is always shown cross-legged in the traditional Indian way.\\nRich carving, elaborate ornamentation and complex symbolism.\\n\\nUse of key sz\\'cz e\\n\\nThe best specimens of Gandhara art are from Jazz/?  and Z7ezz/sz rna stupa at Taxila and from 7gtz \\n:8 near\\n\\nJalalabad in modern Afghanistan. The tallest rock-cut statue of Lord Buddha is also located at Zbx \\n\\' zt in modern\\n\\nAfghanistan.\\n\\nThe Mathura School of Art\\n\\nThe Mathura School of art flourished at the city of Mathura between 1-3 A.D. and was promoted by \\nthe Kushans. It established the tradition of transforming Buddhist symbols into human form. The \\nimportant characteristics of Mathura school are:\\nThe earliest sculptures of Buddha were made keeping the Matsya  64\\'64\\' ,oz in mind. They were \\ndepicted as strongly built with the right hand raised in protection and the left\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nhand on the waist.\\n\\nThe figures produced by this school of art do not have moustaches and beards as in the Gandhara \\nArt.\\nfled 7d / sama:/ sieve mainly used.\\n\\nHere along with the Buddha, the kings, royal family were included in the architecture.\\nIt not only produced beautiful images of the Buddha but also of the Jain Tirthankaras\\n\\nand gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon.\\n\\nThe Guptas adopted the Mathura School of Art and further improvised and perfected it.\\n\\nThe Amravati School of Art\\n\\nThe Amravati school of Art evolved during Satavahna period. This school of art developed at \\nAmravati, on the banks of the Krishna River in modern Andhra Pradesh. It is the site for the \\nlargest Buddhist stupa of South India. The stupendous stupa could not withstand the ravages of time \\nand its ruins are preserved in the London Museum. This school of art had great influence on art in \\nSri Lanka and South-East Asia as products from here were carried to those countries.\\nCharacteristic features of Amravati school are:\\n\\nIn the initial periods, Lord Buddha is depicted in the form of ”Swastika” mark. This has been \\ncarved out on\\nthe cushioned seat over a throne that is situated under the Bodhi tree.\\n\\nAt a later stage the Amaravati School depicted Buddha in the human form.\\n\\nThe figures of Amaravati have slim blithe features and are represented in difficult poses and \\ncurves.\\nHowever the scenes are over-crowded\\n\\n\\n\\nThe images of Lord Buddha from Alluru, Dharma Chakra from Lingaraja Palli, Bodhisattvas are some of \\nthe finest\\n\\ninstances of the Amaravati School of art and sculpture.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n31. Gupta period\\n\\nGupta period witnessed a great development in the field of architecture. The earlier schools of art \\ncontinued in this\\n\\nperiod as well. In addition a new school of art was developed, called Saranath school. The \\ncharacteristic features of\\n\\nthis school are:\\n\\nUsage of cream coloured sand stone Nakedness was missing, more sobre More refined and decorative \\nbackground\\nHallow effect\\n\\nThe standing figure of abundantly ornamented Tara is one of the best specimens of sculptural art of \\nSarnath\\n\\nSchool.\\n\\nBuilding of new stupas and enlargement of old ones continued in this period. Dhamekh stupa near \\nSaranath is an\\n\\nexample.\\n\\nDevelopment of Temple architecture is one of the greatest achievements of Guptas. The temples of \\nthe Gupta\\n\\nperiod brought the new concept of installing statues of Gods in temples, a practice that did not \\ntake place earlier.\\n\\nThere was also move towards the use of stone in construction instead of the earlier brick or wood.\\n\\n32. Temple architecture\\nParts of a temple complex\\n\\nJagati - raised surface, platform or terrace upon which the temple is placed.\\nMandapa/mantapa - pillared outdoor hall or pavilion for public rituals.\\nAntarala - a small antichamber or foyer between the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) and the \\nmandapa,\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nmore typical of north Indian temples.\\n\\nArdha Mandapa - intermediary space between the\\n\\ntemple exterior and the garba griha (sanctum sanctorum) or the other mandapas of the temple\\nAsthana Mandapa - assembly hall\\n\\nKalyana Mandapa - dedicated to ritual marriage celebration of the Lord with Goddess\\nMaha Mandapa - When there are several mandapas in the temple, it is the biggest and the tallest.\\nIt is\\n\\nused for conducting religious discourses.\\n\\nGarbhagriha - the part in which the idol of the deity in a Hindu temple is installed i.e.Sanctum \\nsanctorum.\\nThe area around is referred as to the Chuttapalam, which generally includes other deities and the \\nmain\\n\\nboundary wall of the temple. Typically there is also a Pradikshna area inside the Grbhagriha and \\none outside, where devotees can take Pradakshinas.\\nSikhara or Vimana - literally means \"mountain peak\", refer to the rising tower over the sanctum \\nsanctorum\\nwhere the presiding deity is enshrined is the most prominent and visible part of a Hindu temples.\\n\\nAmalaka - a stone disk, usually with ridges on the rim, that sits atop a temple\\'s main tower \\n(Sikhara).\\n\\nGopuram - the elaborate gateway-towers of south Indian temples, not to be confused with Shikharas.\\n\\nUrushringa - An urushringa is a subsidiary Sikhara, lower and narrower, tied against the main \\nsikhara.\\nThey draw the eye up to the highest point, like a series of hills leading to a distant peak.\\n\\nAt the turn of the first millennium CE two major types of temples existed, the northern or Nagara \\nstyle and the\\n\\nsouthern or Dravida type of temple. They are distinguishable mainly by the shape and decoration of \\ntheir shikhara.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nNagara style: The shikhar is beehive/curvilinear shaped.\\n\\nDravida style: The shikhar consists of progressively smaller storeys of pavilions.\\n\\nA third style termed Vesara was once common in Karnataka which combined the two styles. This may be \\nseen in\\n\\nthe classic Hindu temples of India and Southeast Asia, such as Angkor Wat, Brihadisvara, Khajuraho, \\nMukteshvara, and Prambanan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNagara School\\n\\nNagara temples have two distinct features:\\n\\n(i) In plan, the temple is a square with a number of graduated projections in the middle of each \\nside giving a\\n\\ncruciform shape with a number of re-entrant angles on each side.\\n\\n(ii) In elevation, a Sikhara, i.e., tower gradually inclines inwards in a convex curve.\\n\\nThe projections in the plan are also carried upwards to the top of the Sikhara and, thus, there is \\nstrong emphasis on vertical lines in elevation.\\nThe Nagara style is widely distributed over a greater part of India, exhibiting distinct varieties \\nand ramifications in lines of evolution and elaboration according to each locality. Examples of \\nNagara architecture are:\\n(a) Odisha school: 8th tO 13t century\\nLingaraj temple in Bubaneshwar\\n\\nSun temple of Kornak (climax of Nagar style)\\n\\n(b) Chandela school:\\nKandaria Mahadev temple, Kajuraho Typical nature is Erotism\\n\\n(c) Gujarat under solankis\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\nModhera sun temple Rajasthna dilwara jain temple\\n\\nDravida schools\\n\\nDravidian style temples consist almost invariably of the four following parts, differing only \\naccording to the age in\\n\\nwhich they were executed:\\n\\n(i) The principal part, the temple itself, is called the Vimana. It is always square in plan and \\nsurmounted by a pyramidal roof of one or more stories; it contains the cell where the image of the \\ngod or his emblem is placed.\\n(ii) The porches or Mantapas, which always cover and precede the door leading to the cell.\\n(iii) Gopurams are the principal features in the quadrangular enclosures that surround the more \\nnotable temples.\\n(iv) Pillared halls or Chaultris - used for various purposes, and which are the invariable \\naccompaniments of these temples.\\nBesides these, a temple always contains temple tanks or wells for water (used for sacred purposes \\nor the\\n\\nconvenience of the priests); dwellings for all grades of the priesthood are attached to it, and \\nother buildings for\\n\\nstate or convenience.\\n\\nExamples: Brihadeshwara temple (Periya kovil) Tanjavur, Temple of gangaikondacholapuram\\n\\nVesara school\\n\\nThe Vesara style is also called as the Badami chalukya style. It has the combined features of both\\nNagara and\\n\\nDravida style. The main reason behind the combination is the location of Badami Chalukyas, which \\nwas at the\\n\\nbuffer zone between northern Nagar style and southern Dravida style.\\n\\nThe Vesara style reduces the height of the temple towers even though the numbers of tiers are \\nretained. This is accomplished by reducing the height of individual tiers.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe semi circular structures of the Buddhist chaityas are also borrowed as in the Durga temple at \\nAihole.\\nVirupaksha temple of Pattadakal is the finest example of Vesara style. The trend started by the \\nChalukyas of Badami was further refined by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta in Ellora, Chalukyas of \\nKalyani in Lakkundi, Dambal, Gadag etc. and epitomized by the Hoysala empire. The Hoysala temples \\nat Belur, Halebidu and Somnathpura are supreme examples of this style.\\nThe temples built in the Vesara style are found in other parts of India also. They include temples \\nat Sirpur,\\nBaijnath, Baroli and Amarkantak.\\n\\n\\nNorthern region Southern region In between. Combination of Dravida and Nagara\\nShikhara is curvilinear Shikhara pyram idal\\n\\nNo role of pillar Pillar important No tank Tank may be there\\nNo enclosure Enclosure and gopuram\\n\\nVimana\\n\\nEx: Mahadeva Temple, Kajuraho Ex: Brihadeshwara temple,\\n\\nTanjavur\\n\\nEx: Virupaksha temple, Pattadakal\\n\\n33. Cave architecture\\n\\nThe earliest man-made caves date back to the 2nd century BC while the latest date to the 7th \\ncentury AD. The\\n\\nearlier caves were used by Buddhist and Jain monks as places of worship and residence. Some \\nexamples of this\\n\\ntype of cave structure are z era’ as and IY tzras of Buddhists. The great cave at Karle is one such \\nexample, where\\n\\ngreat Chaityas and Viharas were excavated. The 7 zr/e cases are big in size and the interior is \\nlighted up by great\\nwindows.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nOther than Buddhist caves many caves of Jains and Hindus were also escavated. Some of the famous \\nand\\n\\nprominent caves are at Nashik, Kanheri, Gaya (Barabar Hills), Bhaja, Nagarjunikonda, Badami, \\nElephanta and\\n\\nEllora.\\n\\nAjanta Caves\\n\\nThe cave temples of Ajanta are situated north of Aurangabad, Maharashtra. These caves were \\ndiscovered by the British officers in 1819 AD. The thirty temples at Ajanta are set into the rocky \\nsides of a crescent shaped gorge in the /  a&?  //s of the Sahyadri ranges. At the head of the \\ngorge is a natural pool which is fed by a waterfall.\\nThe earlier monuments include both cW// a W/is and zmasfer/es. These\\n\\ndate from the 2nd tO 1st centuries B.C. The excavations once again revived during the reign of the \\nVakataka ruler Harishena during Sth century.\\nThe sculptures contain an impressive array of votive figures, accessory figures, narrative episodes \\nand\\ndecorative motifs.\\n\\nThe series of paintings is unparalleled in the history of Indian art, both for the wide range of\\nsubjects and\\n\\nthe medium.\\nThe caves depict a large number of incidents from the life of the Buddha (Jataka Tales). Cave \\nnumber one contains wall frescos that include two great Bodhisattvas, Padmapani and\\n\\nAvalokiteshvara. Other wonderful paintings in Ajanta are the flying apsara, dying princess and \\nBuddha in\\n\\npreaching mode.\\n\\nEllora Caves\\n\\nEllora is located at 30 km from the city of Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Ellora has 34 caves that are \\ncarved into the\\n\\nsides of a basaltic hill. The caves at Ellora contain some of the finest specimens of cave-temple \\narchitecture and\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nexquisitely adorned interiors, built by the Rashtrakuta rulers. Ellora represents the epitome of \\nIndian rock-cut\\n\\narchitecture.\\n\\nThe 12 Buddhist caves, 17 Hindu caves, and 5 Jain caves,\\n\\nbuilt in proximity, demonstrate the religious harmony prevalent during this period of Indian \\nhistory.\\nThe nobility, serenity and grace of Buddha are visible in the Buddhist caves of Ellora.\\nEllora caves also contain images of Vishwakarma, the patron saint of Indian craftsmen.\\nThe Kailasha temple in Cave 16 is indeed an architectural\\n\\nwonder, the entire structure having been carved out of a monolith.\\nBhimbetaka Caves\\n\\nBhimbetka is located in the Raisen District of Madhya Pradesh about 45 km to the southeast of \\nBhopal.\\n\\nBhimbetaka, discovered in 1958 by V.S. Wakanker, is the biggest prehistoric art depository in \\nIndia.\\nAtop the hill a\\n\\nlarge number of rock-shelters have been discovered, of which more than 130 contain paintings.\\nExcavations in some of the rock-shelters revealed history of continuous habitation from early stone \\nage (about 10000 years) to the end of stone age (c. 10,000 to 2,000 years) as seen from \\nartificially made stone tools and implements like hand-axes, cleavers, scrappers and knives.\\nNeolithic tools like points, trapezes and lunates made of chert and chalcedony, besides stone \\nquerns and grinders, decorated bone objects, pieces of ochre and human burials were also found \\nhere.\\nElephanta Caves\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Elephanta Caves are a network of sculpted caves located on Elephanta Island in Mumbai Harbour. \\nThe island,\\n\\nlocated on an arm of the Arabian Sea, consists of two groups of caves: the first is a large group \\nof five Hindu caves,\\n\\nthe second, a smaller group of two Buddhist caves.\\n\\nThe Hindu caves contain rock cut stone sculptures, representing the Shaiva Hindu sect, dedicated to \\nthe\\ngod Shiva. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock.\\n\\nThe 6th century Shiva temple in the Elephanta caves is one of the most exquisitely carved temples \\nin India. The central attraction here is a twenty-foot high bust of the deity in three-headed form. \\nHis image symbolizes the fierce, feminine and meditative aspects of the great ascetic and the three \\nheads represent Lord Shiva as Aghori, Ardhanarishvara and Mahayogi.\\nAghori is the aggressive form of Shiva where he is intent on destruction.\\n\\nArdhanarishvara depicts Lord Shiva as half-man/half-woman signifying the essential unity of the \\nsexes. The Mahayogi posture symbolises the meditative aspect.\\nAll the caves were also originally painted in the past, but now only traces remain.\\n\\nMahakali Caves\\n\\nThese are rock-cut Buddhist caves situated in the Udayagiri hills, about 6.5km from Mumbai. These \\nwere\\n\\nexcavated during 200 BC to 600 AD and are now in ruins. They comprise of 4 caves on the \\nsoutheastern face and\\n\\n15 caves on the northwestern face. Cave 9 is the chief cave and is the oldest and consists of a \\nstupa and figures of\\n\\nLord Buddha.\\n\\n\\nJogeshwar and Kanheri Caves\\n\\nLocated in the western suburbs of Bombay, it is second largest known cave after the Kailasa cave in\\nEllora and\\nhouses a Brahmanical temple dating back to the 6th century AD.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nExcavated between the 1st and 2nd centuries, the Kanheri is a 109-cave complex located near \\nBorivili National\\n\\nPark in Bombay. The Kanheri caves contain illustrations from Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism and \\nshow\\n\\ncarvings dating back to 200 BC. Karla and Bhaja Caves\\nAbout 50-60 kms away from Pune, these are rock-cut Buddhist caves dating back to the 1st and 2nd \\ncenturies BC.\\n\\nThe caves consist of several viharas and chaityas.\\n\\n34. The Indo-Islamic Architecture\\n\\nIndian architecture took new shape with the advent of Islamic rule in India towards the end of the \\n12th\\ncentury AD.\\n\\nNew elements were introduced into the Indian architecture are: use of shapes (instead of natural \\nforms)\\ninscriptional art using decorative lettering or ca/// a\\ninlay decoration and use of coloured marble, painted plaster and brilliantly glazed tiles Trabeate \\norder was replaced by arcuate architecture i.e. an azc/z  cKzm\\' was adopted as a\\nmethod of\\n\\nbridging a space. Shikara was replaced by Dome Concept of fzzzr was introduced for the first time\\ncementing agent in the form of alas for the first time in the construction of buildings in India\\n\\nuse of certain scientific and mechanical formulae which helped not only in obtaining greater \\nstrength and\\nstability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and \\nbuilders\\n\\nThis amalgamation of the Indian and the Islamic elements led to the emergence of a new style of \\narchitecture\\n\\n\\nMosques\\n\\nThe mosque or masjid is a representation of Muslim art in its simplest form. The mosque is \\nbasically an open\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\ncourtyard surrounded by a pillared verandah, crowned off with a dome.\\n\\nA zshaZt indicates the direction of the z;z\\'Z \\'a for prayer\\n\\nTowards the right of the mihrab stands the zz zzdar or pulpit from where the Imam presides over the \\nproceedings.\\nAn elevated platform, usually a fzzare/ from where the Faithful are summoned to attend the\\nprayers is an\\n\\ninvariable part of a mosque.\\n\\nLarge mosques where the faithful assemble for the Friday prayers are called the haze Eds/?zdz.\\n\\nTombs\\n\\nThe tomb or zza§de<a introduced an entirely new architectural concept. While the masjid was mainly \\nknown for its\\nsimplicity, a tomb could range from being a simple affair (Aurangazeb\\'s grave) to an awesome \\nstructure enveloped\\n\\nin grandeur (Taj Mahal).\\n\\nThe tomb usually consists of solitary compartment or tomb chamber known as the 7dzr<ad in whose \\ncentre\\nis the cenotaph or zaz? z This entire structure is covered with an elaborate dome\\n\\nIn the underground chamber lies the mortuary or the z/sz;dzzza, in which the corpse is buried in a \\ngrave or\\nqabr\\n\\nNormally the whole tomb complex or Razia is surrounded by an enclosure The tomb of a Muslim saint \\nis called a z¥zrj;e\\'ñ\\nAlmost all Islamic monuments were subjected to free use of verses from the Holy Koran and a great\\namount of time was spent in carving out minute details on walls, ceilings, pillars and domes\\n\\n35. Delhi Sultanate\\nThe Delhi or the Imperial Style of Indo-Islamic architecture flourished between 1191-1557 AD and \\ncovered Muslim\\n\\ndynasties viz., Slave (1191-1246), Khilji (1290-1320), Tughlaq (1320-1413), Sayyid (1414-1444) and\\nLodi (1451-\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n1557).\\n\\nSlave dynasty\\n\\nThis period marks the period of beginning of Indo — Islamic architecture. During this period mainly \\nexisting buildings\\n\\nwere converted.\\nThe earliest construction work was began by Qutubuddin Aibak, who started erecting monumental \\nbuildings of stone on Qila Rai Pithora, the first of the seven historical\\n\\ncities of Delhi.\\n\\nThe Qutb Mosque is one such building. Named as the zg anew‘- zd\\'-is/azzz de/?o’, it is considered \\nas the earliest mosque in India.\\nQutub-ud-din Aibak also started the construction of Qd’zz6 f\\'z¥z< in 1192 (which was\\n\\neventually completed by Iltutmish in 1230). Built to commemorate the entry of Islam it was \\nessentially a victory tower. The diameter of the Qutub Minar is 14.32m at the base and about 2.75m \\nat the top. It measures a height of 72.5m and contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps.\\nShamsuddin Iltutmish extended the Quwwat-ul-Islam Masjid and built the tomb of his son Nasiruddin\\nMohammed, which is locally known as the Wz’  z zrr.\\n\\nHe also started his own tomb (///z/f‘zz/s z\\'s 7*crz ) located in the Qutub Minar complex in 1235 \\nAD.\\n\\nThe /‘crzfz W ZB/Zazz constructed in 1280 AD represents the first true arch built in India, which \\nis produced by following the scientific system originally formulated by the Roman engineers.\\nKhilji dynasty\\n\\nThe real development of Indo-islamic architecture occurred during this period. 7Zo’sszzdr/  was \\nwidely used\\nand the influence of “ W/zrJ’ /’<az //crz can be seen here.\\n\\nAllauddin Khilji established the second city of Delhi at Siri and built the &zr\\n\\n\\n\\nHe also built the far  Zbzue  near the Qutub Minar. The well-decorated\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAlai Darwaza, which served as an entrance gateway to the mosque at the Qutub complex, marks the \\nevolution of another innovative feature in the Indo-Islamic architecture.\\nThe larval 7 zzzzz Eds/?d’ near Nizamuddin in Delhi and the Mia Eds/ñd’ in Bharatpur in Rajasthan \\nwere also built during this period.\\nTughlaq dynasty\\n\\nThe rulers of the Tughlaq Dynasty also undertook considerable construction activities, including \\nbuilding three of\\n\\nthe seven ancient cities of Del hi. Use of zZey sazzd \\'e  can be seen during this period. The \\narchitecture was\\n\\nbaussed  strezg¥\\'h not on the beauty. Hence zz/ z/zmoécora/’/crz is seen here. &  zgr its// is \\nanother\\ncharacteristic feature of Tuglaq architecture.\\n\\nGhiyasuddin Tughlaq built T  a‹fiz ad the third city of Delhi, in 1321-23 AD.\\n\\nThe Tczz c¥°  yas  n T  aq is an irregular pentagon in its exterior plan and its design is of the\\npointed or \"Tartar\" shape and is crowned by a finial resembling the kalasa and amla of a Hindu \\ntemple.\\n\\nDelhi\\'s fourth city Ja/ezy:az¥z/z was built by Mohammad-bin-Tughlaq in mid-14th century.\\n\\nFeroz Shah Tughlaq was undoubtedly the greatest builder among all the rulers of the Tughlaq \\ndynasty. He built 7 zrazaZe@ Delhi\\'s fifth city, in 1354 AD. The famous 77<zzz  A 7 ¥\\'/a  c¥rzzz\\' \\nis the only remnant of its past\\nglory. He is also credited with founding the fortified cities of Jaunpur,\\n\\nFathabad and Hissar.\\n\\nHis construction works were of a unique simple style characterised by the use of inexpensive \\nmaterials.\\nIt was only Feroze Shah Tughlaq who took up large-scale restoration works and repaired hundreds\\nof\\n\\nmonuments, including the Qutub Minar which was damaged by lightening in 1369 AD.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSayyid and Lodi dynasty\\n\\nIn the 14th century under the Timurid rulers, Islamic architecture underwent a change. The narrow \\nhorseshoe arch\\n\\nwas replaced by the laze\\' azcb, an idea imported directly from Persia. They used wooden beams as \\nsupports, and\\neventually the four-centred arch minus the beam support came into vogue.\\n\\nDuring the Sawid and the Lodi Dynasties, mainly the constructions of tombs were continued. More \\nthan fifty tombs\\n\\nof different sizes were constructed.\\n\\nThe Lodis introduced the concept of otzrZz\\'e zXzses built one upon the other, leaving some space in \\nbetween.\\nTwo different types of tombs with octagonal and square plans respectively began to be constructed.\\nThe Tombs of Mubarak Sayyid, Muhammad Sayyid and Sikander Lodi are all of the octagonal type.\\nThe square tombs are represented by such monuments as the Bara Khan Ka Gumbad, Chota Khan Ka \\nGumbad, Bara Gumbad.\\nThe Tomb of Isa Khan, the Tomb of Adham Khan, Moth ki Masjid, Jamala Masjid and the Qila-i- Kuhna\\nMasjid belong to the final phase of the Delhi style of architecture.\\n\\n36. Provincial Style of Architecture\\n\\nThe Provincial Style of Architecture encompasses the architectural trends and developments noticed \\nin different\\n\\nprovincial capitals in India. Bengal, Malwa, Kashmir, Jaunpur, Bijapur are some of the important \\nprovincial schools\\n\\nexisted during this time. Along with the Indo-Islamic style of architecture these provincial \\nschools possessed certain\\nspecial characteristics:\\n\\nBengal school Use of bricks\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nUse of black marble\\n\\nEx: Tantipara Masjid, Chamkatti Masjid, Lotan Masjid Malwa schools\\nAbsence of minar in mosque\\nSome European influence can also be seen in the later phase Ex: Mandu fort, Jahaj mahal\\n\\nKashmir school\\n\\nWooden architecture. The log construction using deodar trees for the construction of wooden bridges\\ncalled 4azdz/s or the wooden shrines called z?aza/s are the best illustrations of wooden \\narchitecture of\\nKashmir.\\n\\nBuddhist influence can also be seen\\n\\nEx: The mosque of Shah Hamdan in Srinagar, Jami Masj id at Srinagar\\n\\nJaunpur school\\n\\nAbsence of minars\\n\\nEx: Atala Masjid, Khalis Mukhlis Masj id Deccan school\\ndistinct originality and independence of style\\n\\nunique architectural style which is a mixture of Persian, Pathan and Hindu forms\\n\\nEx: Gulbarga Fort, Bidar Fort, Charminar, Mecca Masjid of Hyderabad, Golconda fort Bijapur school\\ndevelopment of the dome reached its acme Ceiling without support\\nEx: Gol Gumbaz built by Mohammad Adil Shah (largest masonry dome in the world), Ibrahim Roza\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n37. Mughal architecture\\n\\nThe Mughal rulers were visionaries and their own personalities reflected in the all-round \\ndevelopment of various\\n\\narts, crafts, music, building and architecture. The Mughal dynasty was established with the \\ncrushing victory of\\n\\nBabar at Panipat in 1526 AD.\\n\\nBabar\\n\\nDuring his short five-year reign, Babar took considerable interest in erecting buildings, though \\nfew have\\nsurvived.\\n\\nThe mosque at 7BZxd\\'? Wj;dz at Panipat and the haz¥ Eds/?o’at Sambhal near Delhi, both constructed \\nin\\n1526, are the surviving monuments of Babar.\\n\\nHumayun\\n\\nBabar\\'s son Humayun laid the foundation of a city called ZZz/‹zzzxA (\"refuge of the faithful\") at \\nthe Purana\\nQila in Delhi but the city could not be completed.\\n\\nHumayun\\'s tomb which was designed in 1564 by his widow Haji Begum, was the real\\n\\nbeginning of Mughal architecture in India. The important characteristics of Humayun\\'s tomb are:\\n/2zarZzzj;dz style\\n\\nUse of red\\' sazzdd\\'e\\n\\nUse of round — bulb like dome\\n\\ndesign of the Taj Mahal was modelled on this tomb\\n\\nAkbar\\n\\nArchitecture flourished during the reign of Akbar. The chief feature of the architecture of Akbar\\'s \\ntime was\\nthe use of red\\'sazxdz/  .\\n\\nThe domes were of the \"Lodi\" type, while the pillar shafts were many-sided with the\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\ncapitals being in the form of bracket supports.\\nOne of the first major building projects was the construction of a huge ml  a/  a. Creation of an \\nentirely new capital city at /\\'/   @6z/. The buildings at Fatehpur\\n\\nSikri blended both Islamic and Hindu elements in their architectural style.\\nThe Z d\\'adZB\\'<uza, the 73zwA d\\'7 z/ and the ZB\\'z  c¥° &/eezrz  sir are the most imposing of all the \\nbuildings of Fatehpur Sikri.\\n\\nJahangir\\n\\nJahangir concentrated more on painting and other forms of art than on building and architecture.\\nHowever,\\n\\nsome note-worthy monuments of his time include AZax’s Tcxz at R“/ra  a near Agra.\\n\\nSome of the important features of Jahangir\\'s architecture are:\\n\\nPersian style, covered with enameled tiles Usage of marbles and precious gems\\nUsage of white marble and covered in pietra dura mosaic\\n\\nJahangir is the central figure in the development of the Mughal gardens. The most famous of his \\ngardens is the  /ñz  2Bj;dz on the banks of Lake Dal in Kashmir.\\n£I\\'i“nad z/cfi u/a’s Tzx¥t is another important monument built during this period. It\\n\\nwas commissioned by Nur Jahan, the wife of Jahangir, for her father Mirza Ghiyas Beg, who had been \\ngiven the title of I’timad-ud-DauIah (pillar of the state). Mirza Ghiyas Beg was also the \\ngrandfather of Mumtaz Mahal. The monument, also called as “Jewel box”, was built in White marble.\\nThe JaW  <’s P6rzé at Shadera near Lahore, built by his wife Nur Mahal, is another outstanding \\narchitectural production of this time.\\nShah jahan\\n\\nThe Mughal architecture reached its climax during the reign of Shah jahan. The single most \\nimportant architectural\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nchange was the substitution of marble for the red sandstone.\\n\\nHe demolished the austere sandstone structures of Akbar in the Red Fort and replaced them with \\nmarble\\nbuildings such as the ZZ/tszz-?-hand the ZZisszz-/-7d\\'zas.\\n\\nIn 1638 he began to lay the city of   a/zzz¥zZao’ beside the river Jamuna.\\n\\nThe / w\\'  / a/ ZZ\\'/1 represents the pinnacle of centuries of experience in the construction of \\npalaceforts.\\n\\nOutside the fort, he built the has Eds/r@ the largest mosque in India.\\n\\nHe built the had Eds/?& a/  a in 1648 in honour of his daughter Jahanara Begum.\\n\\nMore than all these fine architectures, it is for building the T “ mls/ at Agra, he was\\n\\nremembered often. It was built as a memorial to his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It is considered as \\nthe finest example of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements from Islamic, Persian, \\nOttoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles.\\nSome of the important features of Taj mahal are: Use of white marble\\nMore decoration Massive size\\nUse of char bagh style\\nUse of pietra dura technique Tomb building at its climax\\n\\nAurangazeb\\n\\nThe architectural projects of Aurangazeb\\'s reign are represented by the &@-4/- d\\'§ aha, the tomb\\nof\\n\\nAurangzeb\\'s wife Begum Rabia Durani, which is a poor replica of the famous Taj Mahal and is also \\ncalled as Taj mahal of South India.\\nAfter the death of Aurangazeb, the Mughal architecture started declining. Aurangazeb\\'s daughters\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\ncontributed in a small way in carrying forward the Mughal trend of architecture.

Colonial Architecture\\n\\nEuropean colonists brought with them to India concepts of their \"world view\" and a whole baggage of \\nthe history of\\n\\nEuropean architecture: Neo-Classical, Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance. The initial structures \\nwere utilitarian\\n\\nwarehouses and walled trading posts, giving way to fortified towns along the coastline.\\n\\nPortuguese\\n\\nThe Portuguese adapted to India the climatically appropriate /Z \\' azz galleried patio house and the\\nBaroque\\n\\nchurches of Goa.\\n\\n2iY\\'ia/ azz7\\'Ar7z zz/°  e,o’?zrz of Goa were built in the typical Portuguese-Gothic style.\\n\\nThe D. /7 ads  z7xrzc/z at Cochin, built by the Portuguese in 1510, is believed to be the first \\nchurch built\\nby the Europeans in India.\\n\\nThe Portuguese also built the /zzr/ c¥° /2wYe//a z›€\\'  zx¥z near Mumbai and added fortifications to \\nthe\\n\\n\\nDutch\\n\\nThe Danish influence is evident in  ,oz/z¥zzpwhich was laid out in squares and canals and also in \\nTranquebar\\nand Serampore.\\n\\nFrench\\n\\nThe French gave a distinct urban design to its settlement in Pondicherry by applying the \\nzgzr/esrazz\\n\\n\\njaw  and classical architectural patterns.\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Church of Sacred Heart of Jesus (Eglise De Sacre Coeur De Jesus), the Eglise de Notre Dame de\\nAnges and the Eglise de Notre Dame de Lourdes at Pondicherry have a distinct French influence.\\n\\nBritish\\n\\nIt was the British who left a lasting impact on the India architecture. They saw themselves as the \\nsuccessors to the\\n\\nMughals and used architecture as a symbol of power. British started a new hybrid style of \\narchitecture called /xz›tz\\n\\n— Wraceza“c sly/e or /  — Q4‘ c sly/e. It was a combination of Indian, Islamic and European \\narchitectures.\\n\\nThe first buildings were factories but later courts, schools, municipal halls and dak bungalows \\ncame up, which were ordinary structures, built by garrison engineers.\\nA deeper concern with architecture was exhibited in churches and other public\\n\\nbuildings. The Church of St. John at Calcutta built in 1787, St. Mary\\'s Church in Fort St. George \\nin Chennai are some of the examples.\\nMost of the buildings were adaptations of the buildings designed by leading\\n\\nBritish architects in London and other places. The Indo-Gothic architecture flourished in different \\nparts of India under the British.\\nSome of the important architecture are: Gateway of India — Mumbai, Chepak palace — Chennai,\\nLakshmi\\n\\nvilas palace — Baroda, Victoria memorial — Kolkata\\n\\nThe British built New Delhi as a systematically planned city after it was made the capital in 1911. \\n&z\\n\\n\\nZzd’ ezzr was made responsible for the overall plan of Delhi. He was specifically directed to \\n\"harmonise externally\\nwith the traditions of Indian art\".\\n\\nThe Western architecture with Oriental motif was realised with chajjas,\\n\\njalis and chhattris, as stylistic devices in the Viceroy\\'s House (Rashtrapati Bhawan).\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nHerbert Baker added the imposing buildings of the South Block and the North Block, which flank the \\nRashtrapati Bhawan.\\nAnother Englishman called Robert Tor Tussell built the Connaught Place and the Eastern and Western \\nCourts.\\nSt Martin\\'s Garrison Church marks the culmination of the British architectural ventures in India. \\nThe\\n\\nChurch is a huge monolith with a high square tower and deeply sunken window ledges reminiscent of \\nDutch and German architecture.\\n6. Painting\\n\\nClassification of Indian Paintings\\n\\nIndian Paintings can be broadly classified as the mural paintings and miniature painting.\\n\\nla/s are huge works executed on the walls of solid structures, as in the Ajanta Caves and the \\nKailashnath temple. They are also called as wall paintings.\\n/\\'la/ne paintings are executed on a very small scale on perishable material such as paper and\\ncloth.\\n\\nIndian paintings provide an aesthetic continuum that extends from the early civilization to the \\npresent day. From\\n\\nbeing essentially religious in purpose in the beginning, Indian painting has evolved over the years \\nto become a\\n\\nfusion of various cultures and traditions. The Indian painting was exposed to Greco-Roman as well \\nas Iranian and\\n\\nChinese influences. Cave paintings in different parts of India bear testimony to these influences \\nand a\\ncontinuous\\n\\nevolution of new idioms is evident.\\n\\n39. Mural painting\\n\\nAjanta Caves\\n\\nThe Ajanta Caves carved out of volcanic rock in the Maharashtra Plateau, situated near Aurangabad \\nin Maharashtra.\\nInside many of the caves are frescoes.\\n\\nFrescoes are paintings which are done on wet plaster in which colours become\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nfixed as the plaster dries.\\n\\nThey are found on the walls and ceilings at Ajanta.\\n\\nThe paintings reflect different phases of Indian culture from buddha\\'s birth to his mahaparinirvana \\nin the 8th century AD.\\nNatural colours like white, green, brown, yellow, black, and a wonderful colour of blue is found.\\nThe human & animal forms show a variety of graceful poses. Various methods were used to create the \\nillusion of depth.\\nThey depict themes of court life, feasting, processions, men and women at work, festivals and \\nvarious natural scenes including animals, birds and flowers.\\nThe place was not far off from the ancient trade routes & attracted traders & pilgrims through whom \\nthe\\nAjanta art style diffused as far as China & Japan. Bagh Caves\\nDhar district in Madhya Pradesh Buddhist in inspiration\\nPaintings are both secular and religious Influenced by Ajanta style of paintings\\nMost beautiful one is that of Avalokiteshvara Padmapani\\n\\nStrong resemblance to the frescoes of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka.\\n\\nJain Caves\\n\\nJain cave temple complex in pudukottai district of tamil nadu Contains remnants of exquisite \\nfrescoes from 7th century Severely damaged due to vandalism\\nDetailed pictures of elephants, buffaloes, fish, geese, jains gathering lotuses from a\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\npond and dancing girls\\n\\nConsidered to be some of the best frescoes of medieval India next to frescoes of Ajanta Caves and \\nBagh Caves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLepakshi Painting\\n\\nAnantapur district in Andhra Pradesh beautiful paintings of Vijayanagar period\\nprovides glimpses of contemporary dress like tall headwear (Kulavi), colored and embroidered sarees \\nof both men and women in the paintings\\nEarth tones and complete absence of blue color in their painting\\n\\nCostumes are outlined in black\\n\\n40. Miniature painting\\n\\nThe miniatures, as the name indicates were small works, which were made on perishable material & \\nhence no\\n\\ndefinite proof of their birth & development can be traced. The Pala School\\nThe Pala School of painting produced some of the earliest examples of\\n\\nminiature painting in India. This school of painting dates back to 7‹h tO 11th century.\\nIt was executed under the Palas of Bengal in the eastern India. This period witnessed the last \\ngreat phase of Buddhism and of the Buddhist art in India.\\nThe Pala painting is characterised by sinuous line and subdued tones of colour.\\n\\nIt is a naturalistic style which resembles the ideal forms of contemporary bronze and stone \\nsculpture, and\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nreflects some feeling of the classical art of Ajanta. Here mostly the Palm leaf and paper were \\nused.\\nThe Western Indian School (12th IO 16a century AD)\\n\\nThe Western Indian style of painting prevailed in the region comprising Gujarat, Rajasthan and \\nMalwa.\\nThe motivating force for the artistic activity in Western India was Jainism.\\n\\nThe illustrations on these manuscripts are in a style of vigorous distortion. One\\n\\nfinds in this style an exaggeration of certain physical traits like the eyes and hips are enlarged.\\nFigures are flat, with angularity of features and the further eye protruding into space. This is an \\nart of primitive vitality, vigorous line and forceful colours.\\nFrom about 1100 to 1400 A.D., palm-leaf was used for the manuscripts and later on paper was \\nintroduced\\nfor the purpose.\\n\\nThe Mughal School (1560-1800 A.D)\\n\\nThe Mughal emperors introduced their own style of painting with Persian inspiration and added new\\nthemes, colours and forms. Court scenes were depicted in grandeur. The background was usually hilly\\n\\nlandscapes. Flowers and animals were also vastly depicted.\\n\\nThe Mughal paintings are characterized by their subtleness and naturalism and often depict \\nhistorical\\nevents or court life.\\n\\nAkbar:\\n\\nAkbar\\'s attitude led to a conscious synthesis of Hindu idioms and Indian aesthetics with the \\nIslamic cult and elements of imperial Safavid Iran.\\nIllustrative serialisation of texts like Ramayana, Tutinama, Akbarnama etc was the mode\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nof painting of this phase.\\n\\nPortraiture was a rarity and female portraits yet greater. Well packed composition, well\\n\\nproportioned physiognomy and beautifully rounded faces, depiction of motion and a highly populated \\ncanvas characterised the art style of this early phase.\\nJahangir:\\n\\nThe art of post-Akbar era did not have the illustrative thrust. The earlier boldness was\\n\\nreplaced by a touch of softness. The earlier crowded canvas had now a lot of breathing space.\\nJahangir\\'s poetic genius endowed with fine imagery and lyricism reflected in the art of his era.\\nPortraits of birds and animals in this era are timeless world classics.\\n\\nHis interaction with European world brought the European technique of shading and producing \\nthreedimensional\\neffects to Indian painting.\\n\\nShah jahan:\\n\\nShahjahan continued Mughals\\' art cult, though with lesser thrust. Romantic in temperament, \\nShahjahan, little liked violence and ugliness.\\nPortraits and random themes like durbar scenes, processions, festivals, scenes of outings etc were \\nreferred.\\nAurangzeb:\\n\\nAurangzeb being a conservative Muslim had no place for art in his court.\\n\\nAfter he died several Mughal governors and Rajput state acclaimed sovereignty.\\n\\nPainters of the Mughal court sought refuge in these states. They carried with them the Mughal art- \\nstyle\\nwhich was amalgamated with the taste and likings of their new patrons and local elements.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThis amalgamation created a new art-style widely known as Om/via/ d g sz/. Awadh became the\\nforemost seat of the Provincial Mughal art.\\n\\nRajput Paintings\\n\\nThe Rajput paintings flourished under the patronage of the Hindu Rajput rulers of Rajputana and \\nPunjab\\nHimalayas during the period 1500 AD to the middle of the 19th century.\\n\\nRajput painting was initially known for its use of a limited range of color, shallow space, \\ndecorative\\n\\nbrilliance and mythic subject matter. Later, the Mughal influences were absorbed into Rajput art in \\nvarying\\n\\ndegrees, due to changes in the patronage, the movement of artists and political factors.\\n\\nThe Rajput paintings can be put under two broad groups: the Rajasthani style and the Pahari style.\\n\\n1. Rajasthani style\\n\\nRajasthani paintings are those works that have been executed in\\n\\nRajputana, from Bikaner to the border of Gujarat and from Jodhpur to Gwalior and Ujjain.\\nThe themes of the paintings were mostly xe//p\\'cxxs az¥:/ he  szz@ecz’s,\\n\\nbased on Lord Rama and Lord Krishna. Court scenes were depicted as also royal portraits.\\nZ2 \\'d’ zzd’/?zzzs aA&r//?az \\' cz¥\\'  s are characteristic of the Rajasthani paintings.\\nThe romance of Padmavati, penned by the poet Malik Muhammad Jaisi, provided a common\\ntheme to\\n\\nthe Rajput paintings. Illustrations of Mahabharata, Bana Bhatta\\'s Kadambari, the Panchatantra were \\npainted.\\nThe Rajput painting developed individual styles in Bundi, Kota, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Kishangarh.\\n\\n2. Pahari Style\\n\\nVarious schools of miniature painting collectively called Pahari, flourished\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nbetween the 17th and 19th centuries in the sub-Himalayan hilly states towards the end of the Mughal \\nrule in India. These areas were ruled by the Rajput kings and chieftains.\\nWith the infusion of new ideas and techniques these schools attained a\\n\\nlevel of maturity and sophistication, which made them worthy successors of the Mughal tradition.\\nThis art dwelt largely on the /’7 ezies azz:/ sets from literature and mythology. Love is the \\ninspiration and the main pre-occupation of the Pahari School symbolized by E?s7zzz azz:/\\'7Bz z.\\nA typical Pahari composition consists of several figures skillfully grouped and full of movement, \\nand\\n\\neach is distinctive in terms of clothing, hairstyle and even pigmentation, which may be blue, \\nwhite, pink\\n\\nor grey.\\n\\nIn 1690, ZBSA?, a hill-state on the banks of Ravi, was the first to initiate the art of the \\nhill-region\\nby\\n\\nillustrating literary classics like Rasa Manjari, Ramayana, Gita Govinda. Other centres like \\nChamba, Kangra, Srinagar etc developed later.\\nThe Himalayan perspective and moderately statured alluring men and women with round faces and\\nsmall but deep eyes, set below a semi-circular forehead impart to Pahari art its unity and \\ndistinction.\\n\\nDeccani School\\n\\nDeccani painting denotes broadly the miniature painting from the 16th Century to the 19th\\n\\nCentury at Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Golkonda and Hyderabad, the former states that formed the region \\nknown as Deccan.\\nThe <?c z cz¥’c¥zz sets, the palm trees, animals and men and women all belong, to the Deccani \\ntradition.\\nEarly Deccani painting absorbed influences of the northern tradition of the pre-Mughal\\n\\npainting which was flourishing in Malwa, and of the southern tradition of the Vijayanagar murals as \\nevident in the treatment of female types and costumes.\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\nInfluence of the Persian painting is also observed in the treatment of the horizon gold sky and \\nlandscape.\\n\\nTanjore paintings\\n\\nA style of painting characterised by bold drawing, techniques of shading and the use of pure and \\nbrilliant colours flourished at Tanjore in South India during the late 18th and 19th centuries.\\nThe paintings are notable for their adornment in the form of sezz -Dec/c¥xs sz\\'crzzs,\\n\\npearls, glass pieces and gold. The zrc7z r&azz\" co\\'ms, dashes of gold, semi-precious stones and \\nfine artistic work are characteristics of these paintings.\\nThe paintings are mostly of z2xdr and Goddesses because this art of painting\\n\\nflourished at a time when fine-looking and striking temples were being constructed by rulers of \\nseveral dynasties.\\nThe figures in these paintings are large and the faces are round and divine.\\n\\nMadhubani School\\n\\nMadhubani painting is a style of painting, practiced in the W/  /a z  zrz of Bihar state.\\nThemes revolve around Hindu Gods and mythology, along with scenes from the royal court and\\nsocial\\n\\nevents like weddings.\\n\\nGenerally no space is left empty; the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and \\neven\\ngeometric designs.\\n\\nPaintings are traditionally done on freshly ,Q’as/’ezed\\'zznd\\' its/is and floors of huts and \\npainters are mainly\\nwomen.\\n\\nPainting is done with fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens and matchsticks, using zzz/zzza/ Yes azx/\\n\\n\\nThe artists use leaf, Herbs, Flowers to make the colour which is used to draw paintings.\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nModern Painting\\n\\nRaja Ravi Verma\\n\\nRaja Ravi Verma of Kerala was perhaps the first great modern painter in India.\\n\\nHe evolved a national style of painting by combining various regional elements like costumes, \\njewellery\\nand facial features. His paintings, which mostly depicted mythological themes, became very popular \\nnot only in India but abroad.\\nHis illustrations of Ramayana and Mahabharata were the most appealing visual representations of \\nthat\\ntime.

Music\\n\\n41. Origin and development of Indian Music\\n\\nThe origin of Indian music can be traced back to Vedic days. The Sama Veda has all the seven notes \\nof the raga\\n\\n4ara/ztx r a in the descending order. The earliest Raga is speculated to be \\'Sama Raga’. ZZzzra/a’s\\n\\n\\nUma  (4th Century AD) contains several chapters on music. This is probably the first work that \\nclearly elaborated\\nthe octave and divided it into 22 keys.\\n\\nIn the beginning music was devotional in content and was purely used for ritualistic purposes and\\nwas\\nrestricted to temples.\\n\\nBetween 2 to 7 AD a form of music called CaZal &zgjee/, which was written in Sanskrit, became very\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\npopular. This form gave way to a simpler form called  wa  which used Hindi as the medium. The Gupta \\nPeriod is considered as the golden era in the development of Indian music. All the\\nMUSIC\\n\\ntreatises like Natya Shastra and Brihaddeshi were written during this period.\\n\\nIn the 15th century AD, as a result of the patronage given to the classical music by the rulers, \\nthe devotional Dhruvapad transformed into the lzz,o a’form of singing.\\nThe P/szpa/ developed as a new form of singing in the 18th century AD.\\n\\nHistorical roots of both W  la  and /gz<zzzz’/c classical music traditions stem from Bharata\\'s \\nNatyashastra. The two traditions started to diverge only around 14th Century AD.\\nCarnatic music is kriti based and saahitya (lyric) oriented, while Hindustani music emphasises on \\nthe\\nmusical structure and the possibilities of improvisation in it.\\n\\nHindustani music adopted a scale of Shudha Swara saptaka (octave of natural notes) while Carnatic \\nmusic\\nretained the traditional octave.\\n\\n42. Pillars of Indian music\\n\\nSwara, Raaga and Tala are considered the three pillars of Indian Music.\\n\\nSwar\\n\\nSwar means a note in the octave. The seven basic notes of the scale (swaras), in Indian music are \\nnamed shadja,\\n\\nrishabh, gandhar, madhyam, pancham, dhaivat and nishad, and are shortened to &, 7Z, zz, W,\\n\\n\\nIt is believed that primitive sound Oum gave birth to Swar.\\n\\nSwar is also called \"szr\". At a fundamental level they are similar to the sob/a of Western music. \\nTwo of the swar\\nare noteworthy in that they are immutably fixed. These two notes are shadja (Sa) and pancham (Pa)\\nand are\\n\\nreferred to as \"axle/a suss\". These two swar form the tonal foundation for all the Indian classical \\nmusic. The other\\n\\nnotes have alternate forms and are called \" /zz/a suss”.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe swar have special relationships with each other. Although there are only seven notes they \\nrepeat in the upper\\n\\nand lower directions. Therefore, when ascending the scale when one reaches Ni, then the scales \\nstarts over with\\n\\nSa, Re, Ga, etc. This is the zz  z  slew. By the same token when one is decsending the scale, it \\ndoes not stop\\n\\nat Sa but continues down as Ni, Dha, etc.; this is the la  zzg \\'seer.\\n\\nRaga\\n\\nIn the Indian Classical Music, Raga is the basis of melody and Tala is the basis of rhythm. Each \\nmelodic structure\\n\\nof Raga has something akin to a distinct personality subject and to a prevailing mood. Ragas \\ninvolve several important elements.\\nThe first element is sound -- metaphysical and physical, which is referred to as 7Bz¥z. There are \\ntwo types\\nof nada, azzz7 rna zzzzdz or un-struck sound and a7 z/’a zaz¥z or struck sound.\\n\\nThe next element of raga is @/c z, relegated into sea  (whole and half tones), and s<za‘r \\n(microtones).\\n\\nRaga also involves the production of emotional effects in the performer and listener, which are\\nknown as\\n\\nmasa. There are nine rasas: Love (Shringar), Humour (Hasya), Pathos (Karuna), Anger (Rudra),\\nHeroism\\n\\n(Vir), Terror (Bhayanaka), Disgust (Veebhatsa) and Wonder (Abdhuta).\\n\\nRaga is based on the principle of a combination of notes selected out the 22 note intervals of the \\noctave.\\nThere are 72 ’has’, or parent scales, on which Ragas are based. Ragas are placed in three \\ncategories:\\n(a) zgdz  or pentatonic, a composition of five notes\\n\\n(b)  z¥z  or hexatonic, a composition of six notes\\n\\n(c) size or heptatonic, a composition of seven notes\\n\\nEvery Raga must have at least five notes, starting at Sa, one principal note, a second important \\nnote\\nand a few\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nhelping notes. The speed of a raga is divided into three parts: fY/all (slow), &  a (Medium) and &z \\n\\' (fast).\\n\\nRagas are classified under six principal categories -- Wzx€y\\', fled:em,\\n\\n\\nOther ragas are derived from these six ragas. The first derivatives of the ragas are called \\nzaj;z1s, and each of the\\n\\nsix ragas has five raginis under them. All the ragas are supposed to have been derived from their\\n//zna/s. Every\\n\\nraga has a fixed number of komal (soft) or teevra (sharp) notes from which the thaat can be \\nrecognized.\\n\\nRagas in the Carnatic music fall into two categories, the base or x s/\\'ala</a may and the derived \\nor\\n\\n\\nThe 16 swaras form the basis for the melakarta scheme. Melakarta ragas have a formal structure and \\nfollow a fairly\\nrigid scheme of scientific organization whereas the janya ragas are rooted in usage and are liable \\nto evolve with the\\n\\nmusic.\\n\\nTata\\n\\nTala is the rhythmical groupings of beats. These rhythmic cycles range from 3 to 108 beats. It is \\nthe theory of time\\n\\nmeasure and has the same principle in Hindustani and Carnatic music, though the names and styles \\ndiffer.\\n\\nTala is independent of the music it accompanies and has its own divisions.\\n\\nDifferent talas are recognised like Dadra, Rupak, Jhaptal, Ektal, Adha-Chautal and Teen-Tal.\\n\\nThere are over a 100 Talas, but only 30 Talas are known and only about 10-12 talas are actually \\nused.\\n\\nThe most commonly encountered one is the one with sixteen beats called the 7*eez \\'aa/.\\n\\nThe Zap is the tempo, which keeps the uniformity of time span. The WJ‘za is the smallest unit of \\nthe tala.\\nCarnatic music has a rigid thala structure. The thalas are defined on the basis of intricate \\narithmetic calculations.\\n\\nThe thalas are made up of three basic units, namely, /a  &zd’axrzand azxz &zd’amThe most common \\nthala is\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nthe  /7 \\'/a, which consists of a repeating measure of 8 beats.\\n\\nday Alap is the first movement of the Raga. It is a slow, serene movement acting as an invocation \\nand it\\ngradually develops the Raga.\\n\\nJor begins with the added element of rhythm which, combining with the weaving of\\ninnumerable\\n\\nmelodic patterns, gradually grains in tempo and brings the raga to the final movement.\\n\\nhe/a Jhala is the final movement and climax. It is played with a very fast action of the plectrum \\nthat is\\nworn on the right index finger.\\n\\n: It is the fixed composition. A gat can be in any tala and can be spread over from 2 to 16 of its \\nrhythmic\\ncycles in any tempo, slow, medium or fast. A gat, whether vocal or instrumental, has generally two\\n\\nsections. The first part is called  //  ?” (Carnatic) or blazer ” (Hindustani) which opens the\\ncomposition\\n\\nand is generally confined to the lower and middle octaves. The following part of the composition is \\ncalled\\n\\nthe  z¥r,‹zz//au\\' ” (or antara) which usually extends from the middle to upper octaves. In Carnatic \\nmusic\\n\\nfurther melodic sections called 7¥zzazzz” follows the zxr/zz// ?. ”\\n\\n43. Comparison of Hindustani and Carnatic music\\n\\nCarnatic and Hindustani are different in terms of their style, characteristics and the like.\\n\\nCarnatic music belongs to the south Indian states, namely Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka\\nand\\n\\nKerala. In fact it is more popular in these regions than in north India, which is predominantly \\ncharacterized\\nby Hindustani classical.\\n\\nIn Hindustani music outside infuelnce such as Arab, Afghan and Persian can be seen. But the \\nCarnatic\\nmusic is totally indigenous.\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nCarnatic music differs from the Hindustani in the sense, that it pays more importance to the \\nliterary part of\\nsinging, that is, it gives more importance to the song as a whole during performance.\\n\\nIn Hindustani music, the music instrument is given equal importance. But in Carnatic, more \\nimportance is\\ngiven to vocal music than instrument.\\n\\nA song composed in the carnatic style necessarily comprises of a Pallavi, Anupallavi and one or two \\nor\\nmore Charanas. Each of these parts of the song is given importance, while singing in the Carnatic \\nstyle.\\n\\nThis is not the case with Hindustani music. The Hindustani musicians give more importance to the \\nraga\\n\\npart of music.\\n\\nCarnatic music has its own way of delineating raga. It does with alapana in the beginning. Alapana \\nconsists\\nin the elaboration of the particular raga in which the Kriti is composed. The alapana is followed \\nby the\\n\\nrendering of Pallavi. It is followed by Niraval accompanied by Kalpita Svaras. The musician is \\ngiven the\\n\\nliberty to explore the raga and the various aspects of raga finally concluding with the Kriti.\\n\\nUnlike Hindustani music, Carnatic music does not adhere to Time or Samay concepts and instead\\nof\\n\\nThaats, Carnatic music follows the Melakarta concept.\\n\\n44. Hindustani music\\n\\nIn Hindustani music, there are 10 main forms of styles of singing and compositions: Dhrupad, \\nDhamar, Hori,\\n\\nKhayal, Tappa, Chaturang, Ragasagar, Tarana, Sargam and Thumri.\\n\\nDhrupad\\n\\nThe word \\'Dhrupad’ is derived from \\'Dhruva’ meaning fixed and ’pada\\' meaning words or song.\\nTherefore, the term\\n\\ndhrupad means \"the literal rendering of verse into music\" and so the songs have a particularly \\npotent impact.\\n\\nDhrupad is the oldest and perhaps the grandest form of Hindustani vocal music.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nDhrupad was essentially devotional in essence.\\n\\nDhrupad reached its pinnacle of glory during Akbar\\'s reign when stalwarts like Swami Haridas, Baba \\nGopal\\nDas, Tansen and Baiju Bawra performed it.\\n\\nIt was adapted for court performance during the reign of Raja Man Singh Tomar (1486-1517) of \\nGwalior.\\n\\nDhrupad is essentially a poetic form incorporated into an extended presentation style marked by \\nprecise\\nand orderly elaboration of a raga. The exposition preceding the composed verses is called afap, and \\nis\\nusually the longest portion of the performance.\\n\\nDhrupad compositions have four parts or stanzas.\\n\\nThere are four forms of Dhrupad singing: Dagar Bani, Khandaar Bani, Nauhar Bani and Gauhar Bani.\\nKhayal\\n\\nKhayal literally means ‘a stray thought’, ‘a lyric\\' and ’an imagination\\'. This is the most \\nprominent genre of Hindustani\\n\\nvocal music depicting a romantic style of singing.\\n\\nKhayal originated as a popular form of music in the 18th century AD and was ultimate in the \\nblending of\\nHindu and Persian cultures.\\n\\nThe most important features of a Khayal are \\'Tans’ or the running glides over notes and \\'Bol-tans\\' \\nwhich\\ndistinguish it from Dhrupad.\\n\\nThere are six main gharanas in khayal: Delhi, Patiala, Agra, Gwalior, Kirana and Atrauli-Jaipur.\\n\\nOie/i“m  eeazza - the oldest and is also considered the mother of all other gharanas\\n\\na /7zarazza - founded by Haji Sujan Khan.

Its most distinct feature is the \\nerotic\\nsubject matter picturesquely portraying the various episodes from the lives of Lord Krishna and \\nRadha.\\n\\nThumris are composed in lighter ragas and have simpler talas.\\n\\nThere are three main gharanas of thumri - Benaras, Lucknow and Patiala.\\n\\nDadra\\n\\nDadra bears a close resemblance to the Thumri. The texts are as amorous as those of Thumris. The \\nmajor\\n\\ndifference is that dadras have more than one antara and are in dadra tala. Singers usually sing a \\ndadra after a\\n\\nthumri.\\n\\nDhamar-Hori\\n\\nThese compositions are similar to Dhrupad but are chiefly associated with the festival of  /. Here \\nthe\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\ncompositions are specifically in praise of Lord Krishna. This music, sung in the dhamar tala, is \\nchiefly used in\\n\\nfestivals like Janmashthami, Ramnavami and Holi.\\n\\nHori is a type of dhrupad sung on the festival of Holi. The compositions here describe the spring \\nseason. These\\n\\ncompositions are mainly based on the love pranks of 7grz e-  rs/x¥z Tappa\\nThe tappa is said to have developed in the late 18th Century AD from the folk songs of cane/ \\n&?vers. The credit\\nfor its development goes to Shorey Mian or Ghulam Nabi of Multan.\\n\\nTappa literally means \\'jump’ in Persian.\\n\\nThey are essentially folklore of love and passion and are written in Punjabi.\\n\\nIts beauty lies in the quick and intricate display of various permutations and combinations of \\nnotes. The compositions are very short and are based on Shringara Rasa.\\nVaranasi and Gwalior are the strongholds of Tappa.\\n\\nRagasagar\\n\\nRagasagar consists of different parts of musical passages in different ragas as one song \\ncomposition.\\nThese\\n\\ncompositions have 8 to 12 different ragas and the lyrics indicate the change of the ragas. The \\npeculiarity of this\\n\\nstyle depends on how smoothly the musical passages change along with the change of ragas. Tarana\\nTarana is a style consisting of peculiar syllables woven into rhythmical patterns as a song. It is \\nusually sung in\\n\\nfaster tempo.\\n\\nChaturang\\n\\nChaturang denotes four colours or a composition of a song in four parts: Fast Khayal, Tarana,\\nSargam and a\\n\\n\"Paran\" of Tabla or Pakhwaj. Ghazal\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe ghazal is mainly a poetic form than a musical form, but it is more song-like than the thumri. \\nThe ghazal is\\n\\ndescribed as the \"pride of Urdu poetry\".\\n\\nThe ghazal originated in Iran in the 10th Century AD. It grew out of the Persian guslz¥z, a poem \\nwritten in\\npraise of a king, a benefactor or a nobleman.\\n\\nThe ghazal never exceeds 12 shers (couplets) and on an average, ghazals usually have about 7 shers.\\n\\nEven though ghazal began with Amir Khusro in northern India, Deccan in the south was its home in \\nthe\\nearly stages. It developed and evolved in the courts of Golconda and Bijapur under the patronage of \\nMuslim rulers.\\nThe 18th and 19th centuries are regarded as the golden period of the ghazal with Delhi and Lucknow \\nbeing\\nits main centres.\\n\\n45. Carnatic Music\\n\\nCarnatic music is confined to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In Carnatic music \\nthere is a very\\n\\nhighly developed theoretical system. It is based upon a complex system of Ragam (Raga) and Thalam \\n(Tala).\\n\\nMost compositions in Carnatic music have three parts to their body.\\n\\n(i) The first two lines of the song are called 73r//er. They occur over and over, especially after \\neach stanza.\\n(ii) Usually the Pallavi is followed by two more lines or sometimes just one more. This portion is \\ncalled\\n\\n\\n73z//a . This is sung at the beginning for sure, but sometimes even during the end of the song, but \\nnot\\n\\nnecessarily after each stanza.\\n\\n(iii) The stanzas of a song are called z7zzzazexd.\\n\\n73rzazx rzz¥zs (1480-1564) is considered to be the father of Carnatic music. To him goes the credit \\nof codification of\\nthe method of Carnatic music. He is also credited with creation of several thousand songs. Another \\ngreat name\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nassociated with Carnatic music is that of Idrdraz’\\'4   z¥. He is regarded as the grand theorist of \\nCarnatic\\n\\nmusic. He also developed \"Melankara\", the system for classifying south Indian ragas.\\n\\nIt was in the 18th century that Carnatic music acquired its present form. This was the period that \\nsaw the \"trinity\" of\\n\\nCarnatic music; 7Z aj;stx a, km    /x? and W   sz¥ ZZ4s1/az compile their famous compositions.\\n\\nId<z¥tzzrIt is a composition usually sung or played at the beginning of a recital and reveals the \\ngeneral form of\\nthe Raga.

It is the improvised section performed with the drummer in medium and fast \\nspeeds.\\n\\nm/dia This is the final part of the Pallavi where the soloist improvises freely and comes back\\nto the\\n\\noriginal theme at the end.\\n\\n46. Devotional Music\\n\\nIn the Vedic period (3000-1500 BC), music was solely ritualistic. Some of the major earlier forms \\nof Indian Classical\\n\\nmusic like OaZazx z &zg/oe/ and  wa,/zzz¥z were all devotional in character. Gradually other forms \\nof\\ndevotional music like bhajans, kirtans, shahbads and qawwalis came into being.\\n\\nBhajan\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nBhajans owe their origin to the Bhakti Movement.

The first involves constant uttering of \\nthe name\\nand singing of the glory of God, while the second describes the various anecdotes of the Radha-\\nKrishna\\n\\nlove.\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe singing of Kirtans is accompanied by musical instruments like mridanga and cymbals.\\n\\nQawwali\\n\\nQawwali is a devotional form of music, prevalent among the szd°ds.\\n\\nThe lyrics are in praise of Allah, Prophet Mohammad, members of Prophet\\'s family or renowned Sufi\\nsaints.\\n\\nIt is written in Persian, Urdu and Hindi and is composed in a specific raga.

Musical Instruments\\n\\nIt is widely believed that the earliest known Indian instruments evolved from the Z7¥z  \\nazz\\'zazrz(bow and arrow)\\n\\nused by primitive tribes for hunting, as also to signal the advent of the enemy. Excavations at the \\nIndus Valley site\\n\\nhave revealed many kinds of musical instruments.

Dance\\n\\n49. Origin of Indian Dance\\n\\nIn India, dance and music pervade all aspects of life and bring colour, joy and gaiety to a number \\nof festivals and\\n\\nceremonies. In India dance is considered to be divine in origin.\\n\\nShiva\\'s cosmic dance, Paz›c trnai,s believed to encompass creation, preservation, and destruction \\nand this\\nidea has been embedded in Hindu thought and ritual since the dawn of civilization.\\n\\nThe dances of Kali, the dark and fierce Goddess of destruction, are very significant. Krishna is \\none of the most popular dancing divinities of the Hindus.\\nThe common root of all classical dance forms can be traced to Z7zara/a’s 7B/\\' asas/<a. It contains\\ndeliberations on\\n\\nthe different kind of postures, the mudras, the kind of emotions, the kind of attires, the stage, \\nthe ornaments and\\n\\nthe audience. According to the Natyashastra, Brahma, the creator of the Universe, created drama. He \\ntook,\\n\\npathya (words) form the Rigveda abhinaya (gesture) from the Yajurveda geet (music and chant) from \\nSamaveda\\nrasa (sentiment and emotional element) from Atharvaveda\\n\\nto form the fifth Veda, Natyaveda.\\n\\nThere are ample evidences of the popularity of dance in the Indian society right from the \\nMesolithic period. The first\\n\\nand the oldest of evidences to date are the discovery of the bronze figurine of a dancer from the \\nIndus Valley\\n\\nCivilization excavations at Mohenjodaro and Harappa.\\n\\n50. Classical Dance\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIndian classical dances are dances of the mind and soul and are extremely traditional. It is very \\nsensuous but the\\n\\nexperience of azzzzz8 (bliss) it evokes is very spiritual.\\n\\n7Bsa (mood or flavour) as the cause of ananda (bliss) is considered fundamental essence of beauty \\nand\\nharmony in Indian aesthetics.\\n\\n1fZzga«a’ (cause of emotion), az¥rZ zzia (effect of emotion) and syw zr/ or  a  c zr/ Zz aizz \\n(subordinate emotions) constitute the state of rasa.\\nThese in their respective order change the &7 z ? Siva (primary emotion) into rasa or bliss.\\n\\nAll dance forms are thus structured around the nine rasas or emotions:\\n\\n1. 7dsja (happiness)\\n\\n2. Ec< z\\'z (anger)\\n\\n3. dZas \\'a (disgust)\\n\\n4. ZZeja (fear)\\n\\n5. la  (sorrow)\\n\\n6. IY<azrz(courage)\\n\\n7. 7 zzzezz (compassion)\\n\\n8. la   (wonder)\\n\\n9. dzd\\'a (serenity)\\n\\nAll dance forms follow the same hand gestures or 7 ez/\\'a has  for each of these rasas.\\n\\nIndian dance is divided into wr//a - the rhythmic elements, wr/ a - the combination of rhythm with \\nexpression and\\n\\nzzz/ga - the dramatic element. Nritya is usually expressed through the eyes, hands and facial \\nmovements. Nritya\\ncombined with nritta makes up the usual dance programmes. Later, as the art evolved, other \\ndistinctions were\\n\\ndescribed, including the male (/azzdza) or powerful, strong, firm aspect, and the female (/as a), \\nsoft, flowing and\\nsubtle.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThere are four strong elements of the classical dance form: s7 zs \\'<a, scu//: \\'use, Fakir\\n\\n/xaz /rzrz and arias\\' /?/ara/’we. These traditions were kept alive by a long and distinguished line \\nof \"Gurus\" who dedicated their lives to perfecting the art form and handing it down to the next \\ngeneration. This tradition is known as the 7z<zz- Rsta\\n\\n\\nIndia offers a number of classical and semi-classical dance forms, each of which can be traced to \\ndifferent parts of the country. Each form represents the culture and ethos of a particular region \\nor a group of people. Classical dances recognized by the Government of India are: Bharatnatyam, \\nKathakali, Kuchipudi, Kathak, Manipuri, Odissi and Sattriya.\\n1. Bharatanatyam\\nBharatanatyam is a classical Indian dance form originating in Tamil Nadu. Bharatanatyam is \\nconsidered to be over 2000 years old.

Kathak\\n\\nKathak dance is originally from Uttar Pradesh. It is a combination of music, dance and narrative.\\nThe name Kathak is derived from the Sanskrit word Ca/7zz meaning story. This dance\\n\\nform traces its origins to the nomadic bards of ancient northern India, known as Kathaks, or \\nstorytellers.\\nThe present day Kathak dance mainly depends on the medieval period 7Bs ZY/a, a local dance in the \\nBraj region of Uttar Pradesh.\\nEventually popular Kathak became highly stylised in both Hindu and Muslim courts and came to be \\nregarded as a sophisticated form of entertainment.\\nThere are three major schools or gharanas of Kathak from which performers today generally draw \\ntheir\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nlineage\\n\\n\\n- It came into existence mainly in the court of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah the ruler of Awadh in the \\nearly 19th century.\\n- It is characterized by graceful movements, elegance and natural poise with dance.

Manipuri\\n\\nManipuri, one of the classical dances of India, originated in Manipur, the north-eastern state of \\nIndia.\\nThe people of Manipur have been protected from outside influences, and\\n\\nable to retain their unique traditional culture. Manipuri dance is associated with rituals and \\ntraditional festivals.\\nThe cult of Radha and Krishna, particularly the raslila, is central to its themes\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nbut the dances, unusually, incorporate the characteristic symbols (kartal or manjira) and \\ndouble-headed drum (pung or Manipuri mridang) of sankirtan into the visual performance.\\nThe most popular forms of Manipuri dance are the Ras, the Sankirtana and the Thang-Ta.\\n\\nIn Manipuri 7Bs, the main characters are Radha, Krishna and the gopis.The themes often depict the \\npangs\\nof separation of the gopis and Radha from Krishna.\\n\\nThe Kirtan form of congregational singing accompanies the dance which is known\\n\\nas &W/z/’aze in Manipur. The male dancers play the Pung and Kartal while dancing. The masculine \\naspect of dance - the Choloms is a part of the Sankirtana tradition.\\nThe martial dancers of Manipur - the 7Zezg•/a - have their origins in the days\\n\\nwhen man\\'s survival depended on his ability to defend himself from wild animals.Today, Manipur has \\nan evolved and sophisticated repertoire of martial dances, the dancers use swords, spears and \\nshields. Real fight scenes between the dancers show an extensive training and control of the body.\\nThe noted exponents of Manipuri are: L Bino Devi, Darshan a Zhaveri\\n\\n5. Kathakali\\n\\nKathakali has evolved from many social and religious theatrical forms of Kerala.\\n\\nIt is a blend of dance, music and acting and dramatizes stories, which are mostly\\n\\nadapted from the Indian epics.

Odissi\\n\\nOdissi, originally from Orissa, is a dance of love and passion touching on the divine and the \\nhuman, the sublime and the mundane.\\nIt is the c \\'zdzs \\' szz<  zgr zdzse form of India on the basis of archaeological evidences.\\nThis dance is characterized by various Z sagas (Stance), which involves stamping of\\n\\nthe foot and striking various postures as seen in Indian sculptures. The common Bhangas are Bhanga, \\nAbanga, Atibhanga and Tribhanga.\\nThe techniques of movement are built around the two basic postures of the Chowk and the Tribhanga. \\nThe ct  is a position imitating a square - a very masculine stance\\nwith the weight of the body equally balanced. The /<rZz/\\'z  is a very feminine stance\\n\\nwhere the body is deflected at the neck, torso and the knees.\\n\\nThe Odissi tradition existed in three schools:\\n\\n\\n\\n- Maharis were Oriya devadasis or temple girls, their name deriving from Maha (great) and Nari or \\nMahri (chosen) particularly those at the temple of Jagganath at Puri.\\n- Early Maharis performed mainly Nritta (pure dance) and Abhinaya (interpretation of poetry) based \\non Mantras and Slokas. Later, Maharis especially performed dance sequences based on the lyrics of \\nJayadev\\'s Gita Govinda.\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n- Gotipuas were boys dressed up as girls and taught the dance by the Maharis.\\n\\n- During this period, Vaishnava poets composed innumerable lyrics in Oriya dedicated to Radha and \\nKrishna.\\n\\n\\n- Nartaki dance took place in the royal courts.\\n\\n- During the British time the misuse of devadasis came under strong attack, so that Odissi dance \\nwithered in the temples and became unfashionable at court. Only the remnants of the Gotipua school \\nremained.\\nNoted Odissi exponents are: Kelucharan Mohapatra, Sonal Mansingh\\n\\n7. Mohiniyattam\\n\\nIt is a classical dance form from Kerala.\\n\\nIt is considered a very graceful form of dance meant to be performed as solo recitals by women.\\n\\nThe term Mohiniyattam comes from the words \"Mohini\" meaning a woman who enchants onlookers and \\n\"aattam\" meaning graceful and sensuous\\nbody movements. The word \"Mohiniyattam\" literally means \"dance of the\\n\\nenchantress\".\\n\\nThere are two stories of the Lord Vishnu disguised as a Mohini. In one, he appears as Mohini to \\nlure the asuras (demons) away from the amrita\\n(nectar of immortality) obtained during the churning of the palazhi or Ocean\\n\\nof Milk. In the second story Vishnu appears as Mohini to save Lord Shiva from the demon Bhasmasura.\\nThe dance involves the swaying of broad hips and the gentle movements of erect posture from\\nside to side.\\n\\nThis is reminiscent of the swinging of the palm leaves and the gently flowing rivers which abound \\nKerala.\\n\\nThere are approximately 40 basic movements, known as a/‘aiar4a/.\\n\\nThe vocal music of Mohiniyattam involves variations in rhythmic structure known as o z \\'/zz\\n\\n\\n   \\n   \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nNoted exponents of Mohiniyattam are: T. Chinnammu Amma, Kalamandalam Sugandhi\\n\\n8. Sattriya\\n\\nThe Sattriya dance form was introduced in the 15th century A.D by the\\n\\ngreat Vaishnava saint and reformer of Assam, Mahapurusha Sankaradeva as a powerful medium for \\npropagation of the Vaishnava faith.\\nSankaradeva introduced this dance form by incorporating different\\n\\nelements from various treatises,then prevalent dance forms and local folk dances combined with his \\nown rare outlook.\\nSattriya dance is a clear indication of the influence of the former on the\\n\\nlatter. Other visible influences on Sattriya dance are those from Assamese folk dances namely Bihu,\\nBodos\\n\\netc\\n\\nMany hand gestures and rhythmic syllables are strikingly similar in these dance forms. Noted \\nSattriya exponents are: Indira PP Bora, Maniram Datta Moktar\\n51. Folk Dance\\nIndian folk and tribal dances range from simple, joyous celebrations of the seasons of the harvest, \\nor the birth of a child to ritualistic dances to propitiate demons and invoke spirits.

The heads, supported by the main\\n\\nrod, is joined at the neck and both hands attached to rods are joined at the shoulders.\\nA bamboo-made hub is tied firmly to the waist of the puppeteer on which the\\n\\nrod holding the puppet is placed. The puppeteers each holding one puppet, stand behind a head-high\\n\\ncurtain and while manipulating the rods also move and dance imparting corresponding movements to \\nthe\\n\\npuppets.\\n\\nWhile the puppeteers themselves sing and deliver the stylized prose dialogues, a group of \\nmusicians,\\nusually three to four in numbers, sitting at the side of the stage provide the accompanying music \\nwith a\\n\\ndrum, harmonium and cymbals.\\n\\nYampuri, Bihar\\n\\nThese puppets are made of wood.\\n\\nUnlike the traditional Rod puppets of West Bengal, these puppets are in one piece and have no \\njoints.\\nAs these puppets have no joints, the manipulation is different from other Rod puppets and requires \\ngreater dexterity.\\n61.

The face of the puppet is decorated with paints, small and thin pieces of gilded tin, \\nthe feathers of the peacock, etc.\\nThe musical instruments used during the performance are Chenda, Chengiloa, Ilathalam and Shankha.\\n\\nThe theme for Glove puppet plays in Kerala is based on the episodes from either the Ramayana or the\\nMahabharata.\\n\\n11.

It\\nidentified five broad ‘domains’ in which intangible cultural heritage is manifested:\\n(i) Oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural \\nheritage;\\n(ii) Performing arts;\\n(iii) Social practices, rituals and festive events;\\n(iv) Knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe;\\n(v) Traditional craftsmanship.\\nThe programme currently compiles two lists:\\n1) The 7d\\' eserz\\'a/? ze ZYs/’ of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity comprises cultural \\n\"practices and\\nexpressions [that] help demonstrate the diversity of this heritage and raise awareness about its \\nimportance.\" This is the longer of the two lists.\\n2) The List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 7\\\\éed\\' & V¿;ezz’ &/zg;zazz zg’ is composed of those \\ncultural\\nelements that concerned communities and countries consider require urgent measures to keep them\\nalive.\\nInscriptions on this List help mobilize international cooperation and assistance for stakeholders \\nto undertake appropriate measures.\\nPrior to this, a project known as the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity \\nhad already been\\nactive in recognizing the value of intangibles through a Proclamation.

Subsequent elements \\nwere added\\nfollowing the assessment of nominations submitted by member states. A panel of experts in \\nintangible heritage and\\nan appointed body, known as the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible \\nCultural\\nHeritage, then examine each of the nominations before officially inscribing the candidates as \\nelements on the List.\\nCurrently no cultural heritage items of India are listed in the \"List of Intangible Cultural \\nHeritage in need of Urgent\\nSafeguarding\".\\nEight items from India were listed as Masterpieces and now included in the Representative List. \\nThese are:\\nChhau Dance, Eastern India (three distinct styles hail from Seraikilla, Purulia and Mayurbhanj) \\nKalbelia folk songs and dances of Rajasthan\\nMudiyettu, ritual theatre and dance form of Kerala\\nNavroz, Parsi new year festivity.
