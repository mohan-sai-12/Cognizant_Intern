Assignment:
 
Using SAGEMAKER STUDIO: 
 
1) Write a notebook to read all CSV files in an S3 bucket 
2) Combine the files to read a single dataframe
3) Apply native AWS algorithms from Sagemaker using
    a) Autopilot (automated ml)
    b) A loop into multiple algorithms and compare them. Use parallelism for data and models.
4) Select the best algorithm
5) Register the Model in Sagemaker
6) Ensure you are NOT using a single machine but a cluster to leverage parallelism
